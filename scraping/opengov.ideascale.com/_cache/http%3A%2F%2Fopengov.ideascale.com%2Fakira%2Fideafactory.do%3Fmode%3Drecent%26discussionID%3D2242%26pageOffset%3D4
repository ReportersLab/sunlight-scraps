<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">The quick-votes (a la CNN style; see CNN.com) are a quick and convenient way to gauge where public opinion lies on existing issues to help drive policy.<br/><br/>The idea is to be a decision-making aid for government.  For example, suppose the President has a tough issue for which he must make a decision.  He has various advisers tell him what what they know about the issue, the president himself will have his knowledge, his interests and the interests of his family in mind, and he will surely have the interests of the American people in mind.  But what really IS the interest of the American people?  Quick votes can be a way to obtain that and apply it to the decision making process. ie, it would be one more component the President can use to help make the right decision.<br/><br/>Because a quick vote is so quick and convenient, the president can have a quick vote put on-line and 24 hours later, after, say, hundreds of thousands of people have given their vote, have a significant reading on which side of the issue the public is on (even if the vote is close, that's important to know as well - the people are split on the issue).  As word gets out, popularity would probably soar as the media puts links on websites and people see how easy it is to weigh in and participate in government.<br/><br/>Another application could be an "Issue of the day" just to continuously gauge the public's view on topics of the day.  This could keep the public involved (both from a participatory and an observatory standpoint), and could become an important resource in guiding the creation of public policy.</div>

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">Background<br/><br/>The state of Maryland has experienced tremendous growth and prosperity over the past decade. During this time, Maryland has led the nation in employment growth and has become one of the wealthiest states in the country.    On indicators ranging from median income to unemployment to advanced education degrees, the great state of Maryland leads the region with remarkable consistency.  It is also a major player in broadening environmental awareness as a result of its national treasure, The Chesapeake Bay. <br/><br/>While poverty has decreased over the past 20 years according to the Maryland Alliance for the Poor (MAP), the Family Investment Administration (FIA) continues to report a significant number of minority families falling well below federal poverty levels in at least 11 of Maryland’s 24 jurisdictions and health disparities at alarming rates are being reported as a result of the state of the environment.  Yet no federal or state guidelines or legislation has been enacted to encourage minority environmental responsibility.<br/><br/>While the health of the Chesapeake Bay, its tributaries and overall environment has significantly declined, the number of people living in poverty has significantly increased, significant geographic differences in wealth and employment patterns have continued to emerge, and no federal or state guidelines or legislation to stimulate collaborative environmental responsibility for the Chesapeake Bay, its tributaries and the overall environment of our communities. <br/><br/>If we don’t act now to include all citizens, these differences can only widen the gap as planners predict increased air, land and water pollution, increased urban sprawl and population growth, and few and fewer stakeholders exercising their environmental responsibility to help restore the Bay and our environment.<br/><br/>Over the next two decades, the region is projected to generate more than 1.6 million new jobs and gain more than 1.5 million new residents, including many new immigrants, African-Americans and retired seniors who will join those that settled here in the last decade.<br/><br/>This future growth provides a unique opportunity to narrow the distance between those currently involved in Bay restoration efforts and those we need on board to help. However, our success in closing this gap will depend on how well the many jurisdictions and organizations in the region can work together to create more collaborative opportunities. It will also require strengthened civic participation to ensure that all of the people who are affected by the environment are included in the forums and processes that guide the region’s restoration of the environment.<br/><br/> <br/>Moving Forward<br/><br/>Across the country, foundations, nonprofit organizations, government leaders, business executives, members of the faith-based community and concerned citizens are engaged in creating greater “regional efforts” When it comes to environmental responsibility.  Environmental responsibility, as defined by the national nonprofit organization the Chesapeake Bay Foundation looks at the impact of damage to the environmental and the total health of Maryland communities and outcomes and impacts of low-income people and communities of color that are uninformed about their civic responsibility to help mitigate the problems plaguing the Bay and our environment.  This emerging field challenges those working to affect change at the neighborhood level to recognize the impact that decisions about environmental responsibility throughout the region has on the lives of low-income families as well as community partners, and to actively work to engage residents in the processes that shape these decisions. Those active in this field identify a number of issue areas that impact environmental responsibility:  The areas are:<br/><br/>-	Economic Opportunity<br/>-	Education<br/>-	Environmental Justice<br/>-	Health<br/>-	Housing<br/>-	Land Use and Infrastructure<br/>-	Transportation<br/><br/>Leaders in the national environmental restoration movement are creating broad-based alliances focused on regional agendas to address these factors and to stimulate greater civic participation in the processes that influence equity outcomes.<br/><br/>In the state of Maryland, a significant number of organizations have emerged as interested parties in minority environmental responsibility conversations.  Nearly 10 state agencies, legislators, businesses and other community partners have indicated their interests.  Many  regional groups have also surfaced, and have a strong interest in developing a coalition actively working together to strengthen efforts to restore the Bay.<br/><br/><br/>The Agenda<br/> <br/>Our long-term goal:	To increase participation in environmental restoration in general and the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries in particular and reduce the  disparities in the environmental community.<br/><br/>To accomplish this goal, we have agreed that there are a number of objectives we need to pursue. But our starting point is to begin to connect groups working toward similar outcomes but with disparate efforts and provide them with the supports to learn, improve their effectiveness, strengthen their relationships and build partnerships and coalitions for change.<br/>Our objectives:	<br/>1.	To build a network of organizations that are working to create greater collaborations in the context of environmental responsibility.<br/>2.	Define and work towards a set of specific near-term initiatives that increase the commitment of regional leaders in restoration efforts and have minority participation in environmental responsibility at the center of state and regional priorities.  <br/><br/>Target audiences:  Regional opinion leaders and organizations working on some aspect of environmental and community health, housing, transportation and equity.  Includes public, private, philanthropic and nonprofit stakeholders.<br/><br/>The Project/Initiative will:<br/><br/>Cultivate leaders throughout the state to be advocates for environmental responsibility.  Participants will seek to cultivate key leaders throughout the state to endorse state-wide and regional work actively to correct health, economic and social disparities in the environmental clean-up process.<br/><br/>Develop a statement of principles for achieving increased minority participation.  Use the statement of principles as a clear first step towards building civic agreement and commitment to cleaning up neighborhoods, waterways, properties (public and private) and the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.  Seek prominent elected officials, opinion leaders and business leaders as signatories to signal the importance of collective environmental responsibility to the health and vibrancy of the Chesapeake Bay and the entire region. <br/><br/>Identify several specific projects, investments, and/or policies that would create greater partnering in environmental restoration efforts throughout the state.<br/><br/>Promote collaboration with each other and with other individuals and entities that are critical to making progress, including key stakeholders such as public officials, business leaders, developers, foundations and individual donors, government representatives, faith community leaders, etc.   Over time, this group could become a resource for groups looking to have more “community voice and participation” and to expand the clout of those groups working on the equity side of the “development conversation.”<br/><br/>Help groups share expertise and resources and leverage outside technical assistance for local groups.  This would include groups providing technical and strategic assistance to each other on topics such as message framing, effective advocacy and community engagement, and linking local initiatives with broader regional agenda. <br/><br/>Increase awareness of the environmental landscape in the state of Maryland in and around the Chesapeake Bay: data, players, convenings and forums, existing partnerships and coalitions, opportunities for strategic work, funding streams, etc.  Participants will increase their knowledge of the different jurisdictions as well as the broader “regional picture”.  Participants will also learn about the efforts of other groups.<br/><br/>Build capacity and knowledge about the developing field of environmental responsibility.  The VESC will be a source of information on best practices for other environmental clean-up efforts underway throughout the country; resources from the Chesapeake Bay Trust, the Anne Casey Foundation, the Minority Environmental Land Trust and other national groups, and linkages to training and learning opportunities nationally.  Participants will feel more connected to the national movement and be continually expanding their knowledge of effective practices and strategies.<br/><br/>Stimulate relationship building with each other and with other individuals and entities that are critical to making progress.  The VESC will plan and conduct its own events and publicize others where relationship building with key stakeholders can take place—public officials, business leaders, developers, funders and individual donors, government representatives, faith community leaders, etc.<br/><br/><br/>Funding:   Initial funding from the state would support an Executive Director to launch and guide the initiative during the one-year pilot phase.  Additional funding will be secured to provide resources for members of the virtual facilities at local HBCUs, colleges and university to dedicate their time to the effort.<br/><br/>Leadership Group:  The role of the leadership group would be to work with a Executive Director to develop the statement of principles and secure endorsements from organizations and leaders in their community; to be the voices of the state-wide environmental responsibility; to cultivate local leaders to be advocates of state-wide environmental responsibility; to identify several specific projects, investments, and/or policies that would create greater social and economic equity in the region and that might serve as good collaborative initiatives for a large set of players; to bring organizations in their community into the initiative; and to generally serve as leaders of the effort. <br/> <br/>Executive Director:  The role of the Executive Director would be to build and support a leadership group; to help identify and recruit other players (organizations and individuals); to help the leadership group deliver on key issues/objectives; and to keep the effort moving forward.<br/><br/>Specific responsibilities and deliverables for the Executive Director would include:<br/>•	Build a diverse leadership group of those willing to take on key pieces of the initiative;<br/>•	Help the leadership group and other participants define an initial list of collaborative initiatives;<br/>•	Support the leadership group in delivery of a few clear initiatives;<br/>•	Drive the process of developing a regional statement of principles that non-profit groups, philanthropy community, elected officials and business leaders could adopt; <br/>•	“Power-map” the state to identify key opinion leaders and decisions makers to target; <br/>•	Identify and recruit participants in the leadership group and broader network.<br/>•	Develop communications channels and materials for participants <br/>•	Schedule and staff learning opportunities and forums, including providing information about the equity situation in the region<br/>•	Facilitate networking and relationship-building opportunities<br/>•	Secure technical assistance resources <br/>•	Develop budget and assist with fundraising<br/>•	Coordinate external communications about the initiative and the efforts of its members<br/>•	Evaluate and report.<br/></div>

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">Some will say that a democratic military is an oxymoron or a contradiction in terms. But, that is because we have not critically examined our military, why it exists, it's purpose and it's place in the society. The US military belongs to all of us, acts in our name and we suffer or gain from the consequences of what it does. Millions of people participate in the military and their families are effected. However, the military as currently constituted does not reflect the values of a democratic society, despite the fact that enlisted members swear to defend the Constitution and believe they are fighting for democracy and the rights of others. Training, discipline and structure are central to military operations, or any operation, but they do not require the current draconian and Prussian military model we have in this country. To say we need a military is not to say we need this one, especially when it has an obsolete authoritarian structure and privileges. No other industrialized nation has an internal military judicial system, for example, nor do they ban unions. Our military does not reflect in practice the principles of the Constitution, the Nuremberg principles and other treaties, covenants and accords on warfare, and often violates international law and breaches Posse Comitatus and other barriers between military and police or civilian functions. We should create a military that respects and reflects the democratic and modern values of our nation and there are simple ways to make this happen in a dynamic way that takes the future into account. A democratic military will also be less of  a force for constant warfare. Congress, the legislature and the courts should work together to ensure the following changes:<br/><br/>1 - Insure that decisions about military personnel are transparent, open to Congressional and court review and public input and debate, and that the rights of enlistees, active and reserve members, veterans and their families are truly respected and that accountability and advocacy are established by independent non-military civilian review and appeal processes. <br/>2 - Own our military as a nation. Begin a national and open debate about the nature, purpose, size and budget of the military as well as how it treats anyone who is part of it. These decisions cannot be made behind closed doors.<br/>3 - Repeal the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the internal military judicial system of courts and prisons and provide civilian court review, fines or imprisonment for violations of civilian law. Eliminate line officer non-judicial punishments including fines, bust in rank, imprisonment, extra duty and grades of discharge.<br/>4 - Require honest recruitment, no quality standard waivers, promises made in writing on the enlistment agreement treated as equivalent to contracts, immediate and voluntary discharge based on recruiter misrepresentation or fraud, and an established period of at least 180 days during with either the enlistee or the military can voluntarily effect a discharge without characterization or benefits, but not without real and documented cause on the part of the military. Provide transportation to home of record in these cases. Also require discharge or reassignment of recruiters involved in two or more instances of misrepresentation. Enlistment should be open to all people who do not have disqualifying or severely limiting physical or mental conditions or age limitations. Gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve and not be segregated in the military. All military jobs and advancement or benefits should be equitable and open to all regardless of gender or race or sexual orientation, and not determined by a biased test taken at point of entry. The true test should be performance of those tasks. Do not make quota requirements incumbent on any individual recruiter or command, but on changes in policy, benefits, retention, or other related issues.<br/>5 - Eliminate punitive discharges of all kinds or any characterization of service. If information of a negative nature is retained in the record or for re-enlistment purposes, it must be considered private and not released even upon waiver to anyone but the enlisted member or next of kin if they are deceased. Eliminate any right to discriminate in hiring or other treatment or benefits based on past grade or characterization of discharge and do not allow employers to ask for that information.<br/>6 - All military service should be truly voluntary and applying for any discharge should be able to be initiated by the enlisted member with documentation or by the military with the performance record or other information that is verifiable over time and not created at the end of term of service. Discharges should be easy to obtain with a loss of benefits proportional to time served. There should not be any "stop loss" policy allowed that blocks discharges. Discharge decisions should be resolved within at least 30 days of application, with independent appeal rights. The government should ensure equally beneficial options for civilian employment and meet minimal survival needs of people so that a poverty draft does not prevail. No return to conscripted military service should be considered or allowed. Civilian court review of habeus corpus should be automatic and encouraged and courts should give no special status to military commanders or their decisions, and common standards should apply.<br/>7 - All participation in the military, in war and in particular wars should be fully voluntary. The rights of conscience regarding war in general, particular wars and even regarding orders considered illegal or immoral during combat, and adherence to Nuremberg principles and other internationally recognized articles and covenants of war and the rules of war, should be recognized and respected without punitive action or recrimination in the case of refusal of duty or of orders. John Kennedy said, "War will exist until the distant day when conscientious objectors are held in same respect as warriors are today." That day should no longer be distant, and we have current examples of the cost of violating international treaties and covenants and breaking the rules of war. This would also insure that pre-emptive, immoral, illegal or ill-guided wars would be less likely to be carried out as long as full and open debate and information guided civilian and military opinion about them. Thus, selective objection would not lead automatically to discharge, but would ensure assignment to compatible duties and prevent improper mobilization. These rights must be respected equally in peacetime and during conflicts because the objections most commonly arise during the practice of war, or sometimes only afterwards when integration of conscience is more difficult. Conscientious objectors to military service, all war, any war and any order should be recognized and accommodated in their stated beliefs regardless of timing and without requirement of proof of sincerity or sanity, as is now the case. Also the laws of war and the principles of conscience should be required to be explained and discussed prior to any enlistment so that we have a military of conscientious participators or we don't have enough troops to fight a war that violates conscience and law alike. If the reasons for going into a particular war are revealed to have been wrong or intentionally misleading, then a renewed decision about participation in that war should be allowed and encouraged. Right of appeal of any discharge decision should go outside military chain of command and allow automatic civilian court review if needed. Objectors should be immediately reassigned to duties that do not conflict with their stated beliefs until the discharge is resolved or appeals exhausted. Any order directly countermanding a prima facie statement of objection should be considered illegal.<br/>8 - Military members and their families should have the right to dissent, protest and organize to improve their safety or working conditions and enlisted members and officers should have the right to form separate unions outside the military command. Unions should have the right to collective bargaining over work related issues and demands with the command once recognized and freely joined by the enlisted members or officers. Family members and others should have the right to dissent and protest conditions of enlisted members without being fined or jailed as under current federal laws. Military members should have the right to free speech, to petition, to distribution of materials, to assembly and to protected methods of appeals for redress and Congressional intervention. Enlisted members should have unrestricted rights of association with unions and other non-military organizations concerned with their rights.<br/>9 - Punitive discharges arising from past courts martial decisions should be expunged, and records of such criminal convictions should be private save in the case of crimes of violence or sexual assault that would require reporting and disclosure in civilian convictions. Transfer to long-term civilian facilities should be arranged for felony-level cases being held at Ft. Leavenworth brig or elsewhere for terms of six-months or longer and then military prisons should be closed and eliminated at the end of six-months as people end their sentences and depart the facilities. All subsequent crimes that would normally fall under civilian prosecution should be immediately referred to civilian jurisdiction with transfer of the individual to such custody or cognizance as the civilian arraignment would assign.<br/>10 - Codes of conduct within the military structure and society would be redrawn and clearly spelled out, with democratic input from enlisted members and the public, and enforced by discharge, denial of promotion, or counseling, training and voluntary correction if they were serious and disruptive. A complete review of all the articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice should be undertaken, eliminating all those that are already covered by civilian law and treaty and those that restrict Constitutional rights and human rights recognized nationally and internationally. A balanced and democratic code should emerge that protects rights and equally limits the bad conduct of officers and enlisted members.<br/>11 - Instances of discrimination or abuse in the military based on criteria of age, race, gender, sexual orientation, or any other factor besides actual performance would not be tolerated, would allow an independent review and appeal process with no recrimination for claims, and would result not only in correction of wrongs done to the individual but in consequences for the officer or person involved in the discriminatory practices. Beyond this individual level of claims, all discharges would be reviewed with this in mind, initiated by either officer or enlisted, and a demographically consistent rate of enlistment, discharge, promotion and assignment would reflect if not improve on the distribution that exists in the society as a whole. An independent non-military agency should be created to both collect and decide on complaints, do the reviews, and suggest policies of recruitment, retention and treatment in practice that would make sure the military at all levels promoted equality of opportunity not privilege.<br/>12 - Benefits and promises should be guaranteed without exceptions to those who fulfill the terms of their agreement once they are discharged. This includes medical and other treatment for those harmed or injured or whose medical conditions worsened as a result of military duty, training or combat, with a much less hostile interpretation of whether the condition is linked to their military service or easily related to possible chemical or radiation exposure in the battlefield regardless of symptoms or previous conditions before entry. Clear breach of promise during enlistment should be grounds for discharge plus fair proportional compensation for time served, and denial after discharge of promised benefits should be grounds for civilian suits for recompense. The existing Feres doctrine, disallowing legal claims against the military for medical or other malpractice injury should be eliminated entirely, making the military accountable. Again, independent medical evaluations during and at the end of military service should be facilitated to help make these decisions about need for treatment for all related conditions.<br/>13 - Leadership in the military command structure, especially in the combat operations, should be a combination of military training and advancement and of mutually agreed respect from the troops under any command. Some military forces elect their officers without ill effect, for instance. A certain level of discharge requests, discrimination claims, and other forms of complaint (petition, redress of grievance, Congressional inquiries, and troop assessments) should be criteria in a command for replacing that leadership in a quick fashion, for discharge, retraining or reassigment as appropriate. Something like a political vote of confidence should be taken among troops being led into any combat situation prior to a final appointment<br/>14 - The public must be given a voice and a choice, just as much as the enlisted are, in what sorts of wars the US will participate in, regardless of how they are declared or sanctioned by Congress. Wars should be the result of referendums, as should be any military response even in a crisis situation. Clear alternatives should be discussed and proposed in open debate for a public decision at the start and during any combat operations and standards for military action or reaction should be reviewed and reset in a democratic way.<br/>15 - Militarization of the society, through excessive profits for defense and weapons contracts, denial of critical domestic needs by a bloated military budget, excessive size and global distribution of military troops requiring large levels of enlistment due to function and to lack of retention and turnover, combat training that does not retrain for civilian life and reduce violent tendencies, destruction of families and individuals through excessive stress in combat due to the nature of the combat, glorification of war and militarism as a mark of manhood or cultural adulthood in movies, toys and advertisements, recruitment and a constant military presence in middle and high schools, revolving participation in both military and corporate leadership regarding contracts and weapon development, involvement of the public in wars both covert and open that violate rules of war and treaty, the rise of the military-industrial-intelligence complex and the national security and homeland security state since General Eisenhower warned about it, massive expenditure of resources, production and human and financial capital at an increasing rate since the beginning of the last century creating a permanent war economy, and the status of the military as an undemocratic and unequal institution within the society and reflected abroad, as a sacred cow that cannot be questioned or changed, must be countered and ended.<br/>16 - The rise of a massive military intelligence structure and apparatus, the Defense Intelligence Agency with all it's extensions in various military branches, NSA, satellite reconnaisance and mapping, and security commands, its encroachment on police function and militarization of police, plans for Continuity of Government and martial law, privatization of military function, surveillance, esperimentation and spying on civilians since the early 1900s with databases on a majority of Americans, its functions under NORTHCOM which regards the United States as a battle command area, and it's control of 85% of the intelligence budget as well as command over massive covert operations here and abroad, threatens the country and the Constitution and dominates domestic, foreign, global and even space policy and militarization. It does this with virtually no oversight regarding even its legal right to exist, it's secret budget, its Black Ops, it's violations of law and assassination activities, its ability to define and expand its own powers, its addition to the secrecy surrounding critical issues and decisions, its extensions into civilian life and politics, and its impunity through virtual invisibility to the public at large. It is far past time for oversight, transparency and review that reveals its history, structure and expansion, replacement of civilian function, domination of all intelligence agencies and matters, and its reining in and dismantling to controllable and accountable size and disclosure, not to mention function. The DIA is without question the least democratic and Constitutional of all the institutions in society, and the least known, visible or accountable. It is time to bring it into public view and regulate its function and question its purpose and methods.</div>

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">Creating an Economic and Political Taskforce<br/><br/>A useful project for AmeriCorps citizens to work on together (I wholeheartedly support the call for meaningful work projects, not just offering stories and sharing views) is creating an economic and political transition taskforce.<br/><br/>Mission of the Transition Taskforce:<br/>#1 Close Failed Banks and Investment Firms<br/><br/>The mission of the transition taskforce will first be to oversee closure of the major banks and Wall Street investment firms that have failed (if they got a government bailout, they failed), and to prosecute the executives who have criminal liability for mismanaging funds.<br/><br/>#2 Investigate and Prosecute Corrupt Government Officials<br/><br/>Then the Transition Taskforce will be authorized to investigate corruption in elected government officials at all levels, to pursue criminal prosecution where appropriate, and to oversee elections to replace these officials. These elections are to be transparent and fair to ensure that every vote is counted fairly. International monitors should be welcomed at these elections to ensure that they are carried out democratically, freely and fairly.<br/><br/>#3 Create a Harmonious International Monetary System: End the Hegemony of the U.S. Dollar<br/><br/>While the housecleaning is being carried out, the transition team could initiate a number of projects to be worked on in a collaborative manner (with people participating from countries all over the world), to create an international monetary system that addresses the issues facing everyone, of living in harmony with our environment and each other. In the pursuit of fairness, an equitable forgiveness of debts and trade agreements could be negotiated using currency swaps instead of continuing the use of the U.S. dollar as the world's foreign currency reserve.<br/><br/>Using Technology to Involve Everyone in the Discussion<br/><br/>This could easily be done in a number of ways, stimulating discussion by people all over the world to come up with a better system for everyone. (The United States cannot make policy today as though it were in geographical isolation. We are one planet, and the U.S. needs to get it together with other people.) Many platforms and media could be used to carry on these discussions and facilitate decision-making, not only the Internet and face to face on Skype or other such programs, but also through podcasts and videos. There could be even be transitional television and radio programs with people coming in live to put in their two cents worth.<br/><br/>Transition Team Guides Global Brainstorming Session<br/><br/>This process has to be open discourse, with everyone jumping in and having their say. Every idea should be considered. This brainstorming session needs to go on for a good while, several months at least, before the taskforce moves to the next transitional phase of consensus building.<br/><br/>Identify People Who Excel at Consensus Building<br/><br/>Consensus building must have great people involved who are really skilled at getting people on the same page with very different ideas and approaches to problems. Are there any people capable of doing this in the entire planet? Perhaps there could be a contest, a highly publicized one, in which trial balloons are floated and people are given a chance to see what they can do. The winners of the contest would be given paid positions to carry out the consensus building phase of creating new systems. This would necessarily involve people from many different countries.<br/><br/>We cannot look to any one leader or even political party or even one country alone to address the problems that we face today. This is an effort that must involve anyone who is willing to apply themselves to the work ahead of us, to steward our planet and have a good world of sufficient supplies, in order for everyone in the world and for all of our children to enjoy a good life.</div>

The burden of taxation should be redirected to corporations and lifted from individuals who pay an undue amount of taxes. Each tax form should include a last page illustrating how the previous year's taxes were spent by category and allowing the taxpayer to indicate the percentage of tax they want allocated by category or to establish a new category. This could be done for allocation of taxes two years ahead to give time to make the budget transparent and to allow referendums to restore critical funding or allocated emergency funds for the unforeseen, but it should not be altered by legislation alone nor by judicial review unless it violated some clear Constitutional intent. I am sure that even a public poll on these lines at tax time would result in a tax pie significantly different than the one created by their "representatives" in their voting records for allocations or the one created by executive action and design. </div>

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">While the three components of the Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government are intertwined, it seems that there are specific constituencies that are better suited to take the lead in helping to implement positive change in each of these areas.  The federal government can model the transparency and collaboration principles by testing and implementing new technologies, sharing best practices, and setting higher standards for all offices and agencies. This information can flow downward to state and local governments for implementation.<br/><br/>Research Component<br/>In the area of participation, we need to look to the grassroots – to those who are already engaged in our democracy.  We need to understand what individuals and organizations are already doing to help safeguard our democracy.  Are these replicable?  What can be done to engage others?  How do we foster and support civic engagement?  How do make active and informed participation in government a priority to busy families?  <br/><br/>Monitoring & Convening Component<br/>Trusted community organizations, such as the League of Women Voters, have been on the “frontlines” acting as government watchdogs for decades by monitoring government meetings, performing FOIA audits, and convening town hall meetings on “hot topics.”  What can be learned from this group and others like it?<br/><br/>Starting Point<br/>Citizens feel most attached to their local government.  This is the level of government that they relate to on a daily basis; from school funding to zoning issues, local government impacts our lives.  It only seems logical that any efforts to bolster citizen participation would start with this level of government. <br/></div>

The key to DSG is that the Dutch engineer who developed it 4 decades ago came up with a way to keep all participants equal in power: Consent decision-making for policy decisions. He also came up with many other surprising structural innovations like the consent election process and self-ownership.

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">An open and accessible government is critical to any healthy democracy.  However, equally important is its citizenry’s trust in its government – in what is being shared and how it is being shared.  If the public does not trust the information that it sees or reads (or the source providing it), then the efforts are fruitless.<br/><br/>There has been a decline in public confidence in government at all levels (local, state & federal).  When asked in a Public Strategies/Politico poll released in January 2009, 62 percent of respondents indicated that their confidence in the federal government had decreased in the previous 12 months, while 8 percent indicated that it had increased.  <br/><br/>Transparency in Rebuilding Understanding and Solutions Together (TRUST), a coordinated campaign to help restore public confidence, is needed.  Components would include:  <br/>1. Convening public conversations about how to define trust in government – i.e., what does it look like?<br/>2. Establishing and adhering to a set of principles to help promote civic engagement<br/>3. Providing federal, state and local government agencies with a set of best practices for citizen participation<br/>4. Educating the public about government accountability efforts<br/>5. Recognizing and rewarding agencies and citizens for their vital roles in keeping our democracy healthy, vibrant and strong<br/><br/>Without addressing this core challenge, any reforms to government transparency are likely to be cast aside – perceived as “business as usual.”  Building upon the record breaking participation in the 2008 elections, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity now to implement the types of changes that are needed to restore public confidence, increase citizen participation and strengthen our democracy for all. <br/></div>

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">Our current system is based on the idea that good collective decisions arise from a competition among self-interested parties. But increasingly we face collective problems that require a spirit of cooperation while embracing individual wisdom and expression. Implementing Wisdom Council processes at local, state, and national levels would facilitate a “We the People” conversation where all of us can identify, evolve, and co-create solutions to our most pressing issues in partnership with government.<br/><br/>The Wisdom Council process is seemingly a lot like other citizen involvement processes. However, it offers the possibility of systemic change that all of us support in a way that is similar to our founding experience. <br/><br/>Every four months a group of twelve citizens is randomly selected from a list of registered voters in the community (city, state, or nation). Each "Wisdom Council" gathers for three days or so, chooses the issue to address, and is "dynamically facilitated" (www.DynamicFacilitation.com) to achieve unanimous perspectives. Following their meeting, the Wisdom Council presents its conclusions to the community in a State of the Union-type ceremony. The "Wisdom Council" then disbands but everyone in the community is invited to visit about the results in face-to-face and web-based conversations, and through social networks and informal reflections. <br/><br/>For example, a Wisdom Council could frame issues and generate solution strategies for other citizen involvement processes to explore, such as those mentioned in the idea proposals: “Use randomly selected Citizen Deliberative Councils to tap the collective wisdom of We the People” http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2971-4049, “A National Citizens’ Assembly to represent the people’s wisdom” http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2535-4049, and “a Citizen Councilor Network: Scalable, Manageable, and Measurable” http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2895-4049; or through Creative Insight Councils, which are similar to Wisdom Councils. <br/><br/>The aim is to involve all of us in one, ongoing, collaborative conversation about the issues that matter most, where we talk creatively and, over time, reach intelligent, shared conclusions. That is, with the Wisdom Council process in place, we can speak in an empowered way as "We the People," establishing shared perspectives, a clear vision of what we want, and realistic strategies for change.<br/><br/>The most important feature of the Wisdom Council process, which distinguishes it from other approaches where randomly selected citizens are gathered to address issues in the name of all, is in the quality of talking and thinking it facilitates. Some processes rely on deliberation where, for example, people are given the topic of health care, with proposed solution options and balanced information. They carefully weigh the options and vote on which they prefer. Other processes rely on dialogue, where, for example, people explore topic of racism, telling experiences, sharing values, and transforming their views. Still other processes focus on negotiation, or problem-solving, or consensus-building as the desired way of talking and thinking.<br/><br/>The Wisdom Council process aims at “choice-creating,” where people identify and address the most pressing issues, think about them open-mindedly and open-heartedly, and seek shared outcomes that will work for everyone. Unlike our normal political decision-making processes, choice-creating relies on individual expression and uniqueness to explore the full complexity of issues and reach conclusions that work for all. Diversity is an asset. Dissonant or minority views can be safely expressed and heard, which in turn, allow us to generate more complete and innovative solutions. <br/><br/>In our experience to date, people resonate with the work of the Wisdom Council. So when the Wisdom Council presents its conclusions at the end of three days, the usual reaction of the rest of the community is to concur, essentially saying  “We think so, too!” Because the Wisdom Council is not given its topic but chooses its own, “the People” are in the driver’s seat. And the process is ongoing instead of being finished when the topic is completed. <br/><br/>For more information: See the book, “Society’s Breakthrough! Releasing Essential Wisdom and Virtue in All the People” (www.SocetysBreakthrough.com) The Center for Wise Democracy (www.WiseDemocracy.org) is a non profit organization has many articles and videos, and has helped interested citizen groups learn about this process and experiment with it in Victoria BC, Oakland CA, Pleasantville NY and other cities. Arising from these experiments the government of the state of Vorarlberg in Austria is helping organize Wisdom Councils in that region, where citizens become involved in solving difficult problems. In 2010 a prominent nonprofit organization in the country of Armenia will begin the first national trial there.<br/></div>

Many wish to limit the size of such structures. Some talk about the increase in taxes that will be incurred by larger roads to serve the shopping area. The idea I liked was for the shopping center to locate itself on the old D&H railway right of way and establish light rail connecting outlying communities to Albany. The shopping center could have their own station and people wishing to visit could park anywhere along the right of way and catch the train to the shopping maul for free. The cost to the taxpayer would be less in the long run and there would be many other advantages to the locals and business.</div>

Only certain forms work for this but they work very well.  These trainings are best done over time to teach a skill, allow practice of the skill, return to share experiences and best practices, apply again: action learning.<br/><br/>Dialogue tools help individuals understand across differences, share experiences, listen for common threads in someone else's viewpoint, combine diverse ideas or cultural ways of looking at things to solve problems, gather data to see a full-systems perspective on an issue or opportunity, engage people, foster collaboration, and tap into rich knowledge and cultural diversity in the process.<br/><br/>Use professional facilitators who are skilled in these particular methods and who also understand how to teach.  They can be the mentors to the community facilitators as a community of learning and practice is fostered.  <br/><br/>Invitation is essential - invite across organization, region, age, ability, experience, culture, class - the key is to identify and train people who set ego aside in service to the group and its work - who invite and engage rather than direct.</div>

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">I would suggest that the best way to strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness, while making government more transparent, participatory, and collaborative, would be for the Obama Administration to lead the American People in Developing and Implementing a National Strategy for Sustainability. <br/><br/>It is commonly recognized that those of us in the United States are not living sustainably today. With only 5% of the world’s population, we consume 1/4 of the natural resources. Since 1940, Americans alone have used more of the earth’s mineral resources than all previous humans put together. We still only recycle about 15% of our waste; use 120 pounds of natural resources per person per day; and greenhouse gas emissions rose 13 percent in the US between 1990 and 2003 according to the EPA’s 2007 Report on the Environment. Meanwhile humanity uses 30% more of the earth’s bio-capacity than can be sustained. At this rate, we’ll need two planets to live on to meet everyone's needs by 2030.<br/><br/>Fortunately, millions of Americans are already doing what we can to change the situation and to contribute to creating a more sustainable future. Now our federal government needs to lead the people in creating a Sustainable America.<br/><br/>GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT<br/><br/>The US agreed to create a National Strategy for Sustainability during the UN Rio Earth Summit Conference in 1992 and then again at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. The US is one of the few Developed Countries that has not already developed, much less implemented, a National Strategy Plan. The Obama Administration should thus invite all Americans to join it in developing and implementing our National Strategy for Sustainability, beginning with a review of the reports and recommendations from the President’s Council on Sustainable Development that were developed during the Clinton years. See:  See:  http://clinton5.nara.gov/PCSD<br/><br/>The National Strategy could encourage such things as green building practices; transitioning to renewable energy; protecting and restoring the natural environment; limiting toxic chemicals; investing in all types of green jobs; adopting sustainable business practices; educating for sustainable development; ensuring that all people’s basic human needs can be met; and integrating the work of artists, engineers, educators, and restoration scientists on infrastructure, restoration, and other sustainable community projects; etc.     <br/><br/>(This recommendation and description of the National Strategy for Sustainability is rather long as it is meant to introduce the idea to key people within the Obama Administration. If you want to know more about it please continue reading, however if not but you still like the idea please vote for it now.)<br/><br/>There is already a lot of interest and support for this idea of creating a National Strategy for Sustainability. In December I entered a proposal urging the Obama Administration to develop and implement a National Strategy for Sustainability in Change.org’s Ideas for Change in America web voting competition. It made it in the Top Ten out of more than 7800 Ideas entered and 600,000 votes cast and was in first place within the category of Environmental Conservation. <br/><br/>GOALS, GUIDELINES, AND PRINCIPLES<br/><br/>The development of a National Strategy for Sustainability ought to be based upon an agreed set of guidelines and principles, such as those developed by the OECD, beginning with a participatory and collaborative process (see: http://www.oecd.org/DATAOECD/34/10/2669958.PDF page 73). Coordinated and cooperative action is needed and the federal government needs to lead the way. The Strategy should include an Action Plan, authorizing legislation, and a significant budget and appropriations. An Office of Sustainability ought to be established, along with inter-agency working group(s) and a cabinet level committee on sustainability. Each state could be required to issue an annual report on sustainability. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the National Strategy for Sustainability ought to be to make as rapid a transition to full sustainability as is feasibly possible. A system of metrics and indicators is needed along with a Visioning and Planning Process which encourages the participation of the American People in determining our common future. In fact, the Administration ought to support civil society in playing a leading role in developing an independent multi-stakeholder process that fully involves all serious and committed contributors in driving the development of the National Strategy for Sustainability. <br/><br/>The National Academy of Public Administration and the National Academy of Sciences are two Congressionally chartered, non-profit, non-partisan institutions that provide an example of the type of entity that could be established with the mandate to lead the process of developing and implementing a National Strategy, which would include but also go well beyond government participation and activities. <br/><br/>GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION<br/><br/>At the global level, preparations and consultations have already begun again at the United Nations for the 20th Anniversary of the Earth Summit Conference which will most likely be held again in Brazil in 2012. The US is going to look pretty foolish if we are one of the only developed countries that is not yet implementing a Sustainability Strategy and Plan. In addition, the federal government ought to be developing a process to encourage multi-stakeholder input and participation in the preparatory process for the Summit; and the effort to create a US Strategy could provide a good means for doing so. <br/><br/>The United Nations is also completing a ten year Marrakech Process to develop a Global Framework of Action on Sustainable Consumption and Production; and our federal government has just begun to participate actively in this process within the last year or two, though it did host a North American consultation in Washington DC in November of 2008. (http://esa.un.org/marrakechprocess) The Obama Administration should thus integrate the development of a National Framework on Sustainable Consumption and Production with our National Strategy for Sustainability and ensure that both are integrated as well with the Global Framework. <br/><br/>EDUCATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT<br/><br/>We are also now half way through the UN Decade on Education for Sustainable Development and UNESCO recently held it’s five year review conference for the Decade in Bonn (http://www.desd.org). In the US the US Partnership for Education on Sustainable Development has been leading the organizing effort (www.uspartnership.org); but unfortunately the federal government has provided very little leadership to date in engaging our country in this global process. <br/><br/>The US Partnership developed a series of recommendations, in partnership with the Working Group for Sustainable Change, which we submitted to the Obama Administration and Transition Teams for how the US could strengthen its involvement and promote Education for Sustainable Development. These recommendations should be considered both by the Department of Education and as we work on developing and implementing both the National Strategy and the Ten Year Framework on Sustainable Consumption and Production. (see: http://change.gov/open_government/entry/us_partnership_on_education_for_sustainable_development/)<br/><br/>STRENGTHENING AND RENEWING PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVES<br/><br/>During the run up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 several hundred UN Partnership Initiatives were also developed. Both the Bush and Obama Administrations have taken quite an interest in many of these Partnership Initiatives. They provide an excellent means for implementing sustainability programs and policies both in the US and around the world. Unfortunately, most of them remain rather under-capitalized and need much more funding to be able to fulfill the great promise and urgent role that they could provide. As a part of the development of the National Strategy for Sustainability the federal government should thus review these Partnership Initiatives and determine what could be done in the US and by our government to strengthen them; and the US citizenry should be invited to participate actively in this review process as well. (See: http://www.usda.gov/oce/sustainable/partnerships.htm and http://www.sdp.gov/usgweb.) <br/><br/>The STAR Community Index is a new framework for improving the livability and sustainability of U.S. communities. ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability USA, the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and the Center for American Progress (CAP) have established a partnership to develop STAR with the goal of launching this tool in January 2010. (see: http://www.iclei-usa.org/programs/sustainability/star-community-index) The STAR website states that, “there is a pressing need for a national framework to guide sustainable community initiatives. Many local governments have already developed frameworks, while others are seeking a framework that can be adapted to reflect local conditions. These frameworks offer a vast diversity in the structure and focus making it very difficult to compare the progress of one locality to another and reducing the opportunity to leverage change and share lessons learned.” <br/><br/>A similar situation exists but the need is perhaps even more pronounced within the business community, educational institutions, and particularly within and among state governments. The development of a National Strategy should thus incorporate and promote the development of the STAR Community Index and support the development of similar such initiatives for businesses, educational institutions, rural communities, and state governments. <br/> <br/>THE PRESIDENT’S MEMORANDUM ON TRANSPARENCY AND OPEN GOVERNMENT<br/><br/>As one of his first acts in office President Obama issued a Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government in which he outlined three principles for his administration: transparency, participation, and collaboration. The Memorandum states that, “Collaboration actively engages Americans in the work of their Government. Executive departments and agencies should use innovative tools, methods, and systems to cooperate among themselves, across all levels of Government, and with nonprofit organizations, businesses, and individuals in the private sector.” <br/><br/>There could probably be no better way to engage the American people in the work of our government, at all levels, than to develop and begin to implement a National Strategy for Sustainability. Non-profit organizations, businesses, individuals, educators, and government employees at all levels are already doing what they can to contribute to creating a sustainable future; and we would welcome the opportunity, if provided by the federal government, to provide our expertise on how our country can do so as well. <br/><br/>SHARING THE EXPERTISE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH GOVERNMENT<br/><br/>The Memorandum goes on to state that, “Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. Executive departments and agencies should offer Americans increased opportunities to participate in policymaking and to provide their Government with the benefits of their collective expertise and information.”  Again, the development of a National Strategy and a Ten Year Framework on Sustainable Consumption and Production would provide an excellent vehicle to enable the American people to share our collective expertise and information with government departments and agencies. <br/><br/>This would now include a multitude of initiatives that have been developed or are now springing up such as: the ABA’s Model Sustainability Policy and Implementation Guidelines for Law Organizations, the Environmental Law Institute, the US Green Building Council’s LEED Program, National Ski Areas Association’s Sustainable Slopes Environmental Charter, California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance, AIGA Center for Sustainable Design, Green-Blue Institute’s Design Competitions, various Standards and Certification Schemes, and a great number of business consultants specializing in sustainable development. <br/><br/>Then there is the PlugIn Hybrid Electric Vehicle Partnership, ICLEI’s Star Community Index, SustainLane’s Sustainable Development knowledge base for State and Local Government officials, Sustainable Land Development International, the Bioneers, BioMimicry Guild, Zero Waste Alliance, Center for a New American Dream, Lowell Center for Sustainable Production, North American Sustainable Consumption Alliance, US Citizens Network for Sustainable Development, Sustainable Communities Network, etc. These are just a few examples of the many people and initiatives, showing just a bit of the breadth of the movement, that would eagerly embrace the opportunity to share their knowledge and information with government at all levels.  <br/><br/>OVERCOMING POLICY IMPEDIMENTS AND EMBRACING COLLABORATION<br/><br/>Now I would like to respond to two questions raised as a part of this Open Government Dialogue process. We’ve been asked, “What policy impediments to innovation in government currently exist?”<br/><br/>There is currently a lack of coordination of activities within and among agencies at all levels of government; lack of a coordinated approach toward dealing effectively with a host of urgent problems that must be solved to create a more sustainable future; coordinated means by which all stakeholders can contribute effectively to providing common solutions that could be replicated throughout our society; etc. These problems could all be solved through an effect effort to develop and implement a National Strategy for Sustainability. <br/><br/>“What is the best way to change the culture of government to embrace collaboration?”<br/><br/>The Obama Administration could develop an open and participatory process welcoming all Americans to join in developing and implementing a National Strategy for Sustainability, including such stakeholders as municipal and state government, the business community, educational leaders and students, civil society, etc. The effectiveness of such partnership processes has been demonstrated time and again through collaborations such as the US Partnership on Education for Sustainable Development, the National Council on Science and the Environment, the President’s Council on Sustainable Development, the National Academy of Sciences Board on Sustainable  Development/Report, the National Summit on Sustainable Development, UN Commission on Sustainable Development processes, UN Partnership Initiatives for Sustainable Development, etc. <br/><br/>ACHIEVING A SUSTAINABLE AMERICA<br/><br/>Finally, Law Professor John Dernbach’s latest book, Agenda for a Sustainable America starts with a simple but powerful premise: “Sustainable development would make the United States more livable, healthy, secure, and prosperous. Policies that promote sustainability would reduce risks to our national security, improve our economic efficiency and productivity, enhance our health and communities, improve the lives of the poorest among us, and foster greater human wellbeing in other countries. And it would achieve these things while protecting and restoring the environment for our generation and for generations that follow.”<br/><br/>Now those are goals that would be worth striving for as we develop and begin to implement our National Strategy for Sustainability. <br/><br/>For more information please contact:<br/><br/>Rob Wheeler<br/>Campaign for a Sustainable America<br/>Robineagle @ worldcitizen.org<br/>Robwheeler22 @ gmail.com<br/>717-264-5036<br/><br/>Citizens Network for Sustainable Development<br/>www.citnet.org<br/><br/></div>

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">The concept of “crowd-sourced accountability” -- opening up data for the public to analyze and serve as the government’s eyes and ears to spot potential misuse of government funds -- offers intriguing possibilities. <br/><br/>But it also raises an important question for government officials, spanning the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, the Government Accountability Office, federal agencies, states, and localities: How can the government manage a potential avalanche of input, sort through millions of comments and allegations, focus scarce resources for maximum impact, and safeguard citizens from potential harassment and false accusations? <br/><br/>One answer – both for speed and effectiveness – is to tap into existing models that federal agencies are using to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. <br/><br/>For example, the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) program run by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) focuses on detecting and correcting improper payments in the Medicare fee-for-service program. Congress legislated a demonstration RAC program under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. According to the CMS Recovery Audit Contractor Website (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/RAC/), “The RAC demonstration program has proven to be successful in returning dollars to the Medicare Trust Funds and identifying monies that need to be returned to providers. It has provided CMS with a new mechanism for detecting improper payments made in the past, and has also given CMS a valuable new tool for preventing future payments.” Based on this success, CMS is rolling out the program in states across the country this year. <br/><br/>One important factor in the CMS program’s success has been applying technology to help auditors and investigators sort through large volumes of data to spot areas of fraud, waste, and abuse and trigger investigative action. This use of technology maps ties well to an idea request posted by the RATB during the recent National Dialogue on Recovery Act information technology solutions -- at http://www.thenationaldialogue.org/ideas/hotline-and-case-referral-solutions -- asking for hotline and case referral solutions. Additional related ideas were also posted to the Recovery Act National Dialogue at http://www.thenationaldialogue.org/ideas/protecting-stimulus-funds-from-fraud-waste-and-abuse.  <br/><br/>More on this idea is posted at http://www.collaborativegov.org/MyBlog/recovery-act-accountability-harnessing-the-power-of-the-crowd.html <br/></div>

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">While dialog and deliberation techniques (America Speaks, Deliberative Juries, Open Space, World Café, etc) all have important roles to play in increasing public participation, their proponents may benefit from considering some additional working assumptions and principles.<br/><br/>Crowd wisdom principles<br/><br/>1.	The wisdom of crowds is best evoked when we get beyond the pros and cons of any single policy alternative and consider the complex systems within which any policy must co-exist.<br/>2.	The wisdom of crowds is energized when the future is the canvas for co-creative thinking. <br/>3.	The wisdom of crowds is best channeled by combining rich objective data with informal and imaginative processes.  <br/>4.	The wisdom of crowds is best expressed in stories about tomorrow, sometimes called scenarios. <br/>5.	The wisdom of crowds can be tapped through voting, but only after concrete and divergent visions have been expressed.<br/>6.	The wisdom of crowds provides the best lens for identifying truly alternative and actionable options.<br/><br/>Working Assumptions<br/><br/>1.	Learning how complex the world is can be hard work.  The general population is quite capable of learning to think systematically if they are supported by safe, information rich, informal processes that incorporate indirect learning as a side effect of engaging activities.  <br/>2.	Stories are a key to both cognitive and emotional engagement. For most people, the ability to hold complex ideas in memory depends on whether those ideas are woven into a narrative that is compelling; one that is driven by recognizable characters and that has an internal logic and consistency. <br/>3.	Voting on a partial or incomplete story can be a helpful precursor to voting a policy alternative up or down.  For example, participants can be asked “Do you think a particular event could happen, would it matter if it did, and under which version of the future is this event more likely to happen?”  Answers to these questions spark discussion of possibilities without closing off alternatives. <br/>4.	Stories can be finer grained and more nuanced than policies.  At the same time, they are ‘just stories.’  They don’t carry the weight and political consequences of a policy vote.  <br/><br/><br/>Who writes and edits public participation stories or scenarios?<br/><br/>Scenarios are compelling stories about alternative futures.  Effective scenarios animate a large number of facts and considerations.  Few members of the general public have the desire, interest, or skills necessary to write compelling scenarios from scratch.  But most people directly affected by a policy have the desire, interest and skills necessary to discuss, learn from, and accept or edit elements of scenarios that are offered for their consideration.<br/><br/>Facilitator/authors can start the scenario process, creating initial stories from research and interviews and guiding participants through review and editing activities.  Participants in an interactive scenario workshop analyze stories, add their own responses to questions, and develop a larger narrative that explains how the initial story could happen, the forces that would have to line up to help or hinder it, and the actions that would have to be taken between now and a future date to make the scenario happen.<br/><br/>The scenarios matter, but they are primarily a springboard.  The real payoffs are the creative policy recommendations and the citizen empowerment that results.<br/><br/>Where have scenarios fostered public engagement and empowerment?<br/><br/>Scenario-based public engagement of has worked well in critical situations, most notably in South Africa at the end of apartheid <br/>(http://gcp.aspen.grida.no/training/manual/module6.aspx).   Diverse groups of stakeholders were engaged by encountering sharply different stories about the possible future of their country. The stories were not ‘top down’ predictions, they were invitations to have a structured exploration of what could happen, to learn how the complex elements of society interact, and to discover what could be done to encourage the best possibilities. <br/><br/>Calling this approach scenario planning understates its power.  Peer-learning and community-building are important parts of its legacy. The citizen planners themselves come to share knowledge, skills, perspective and purpose.  Graduates of a scenario deliberation workshop form a critical mass of scenario-fluent thinkers who can become valuable pro-active teachers and facilitators in their communities.<br/><br/>Closer to home,  my colleagues and I have helped engage stakeholders in scenario projects by writing short newspaper stories that describe events that could happen by various dates in the future if present trends continue or if alternative policies are adopted. We do not ask people to accept our stories as true; we invite them to make that determination themselves in consultation with their peers. We also ask them to "finish" the stories since they are deliberately incomplete. Participants are asked to be reporters from the future, reflecting back creatively on their vision of what is possible between now and a future date. We ask them ‘report’ on how alternative policies and programs worked or didn’t, who was helped or hurt, and how opposing positions and the concerns of the most vulnerable were met. <br/><br/>Participants begin their engagement by choosing which future news stories come closest to their initial vision of the future. Their choices tend to provoke productive learning conversations as other participants seek to understand the reasons behind each other’s opinions. Unlike fixed beliefs that are grounded in the in the past, no one knows for sure what will happen in the future. A brief review of recent events is usually sufficient to gain agreement that no one’s personal predictions should take precedence. So the uncertainty and risk inherent in the future actually opens up the discussion. As facilitators, we compare responses and votes on news stories from different teams advocating or defending different future policies and feed this back to the participants so that it becomes an input to their overall deliberation. <br/><br/>Voting to discern before voting to decide<br/><br/>Citizens get to "try out” a version of their ideas or preferences and see how they compare and play out before getting caught up in the high-stakes debate. New and old ideas combine. Implications are uncovered and their validity tested. Voting about hypothetical futures and finding out how your opinions compare with others is engaging enough to motivate learning. At the same time, it is less contentious than a "final" vote or even a ranking vote on a list of issues or questions. None of the alternative future stories is taken as ‘given.’  Each is examined and then put aside to become a possible ingredient in a later new or modified scenario. <br/></div>

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">An Explanation: Why America deserves A New American School and how do we get there from here?<br/><br/> “America’s high schools are obsolete.  By obsolete, I don’t just mean that they’re broken, flawed or just underfunded, though a case could be made for every one of those points.  By obsolete, I mean our high schools – even when they’re working as designed—cannot teach all our students what they need to know today.”  <br/>by Bill Gates<br/><br/>PREFACE<br/>Although one may be certain that there is no single remedy to resolve the problem of what ails education, it must be noted that the existing framework supporting the present system of a standardized, one-size-curricula-fits-all model, in an all-out effort to funnel age-related cohorts lock-step through high school, is indeed, obsolete as Mr. Gates dutifully contends.  I totally agree with and acknowledge his sentiment.  The truth is our present system was not designed to teach students the skills needed for a global economy.  Furthermore a warning:  Do not count on entrenched educational leaders to do any more than reactively resort to patchwork policy measures that shall continue to bolster dysfunctional public education.<br/>In fact, as long as the existing public education paradigm’s framework is supported by the current funding process, then the present system and those responsible for its operation will continue to have little or no incentive to innovate in order to meet new challenges. A system comprised of quasi-professionals, supported by a nontransparent, unstable funding process, and finally, propped up by an obsolete paradigm is deeply mired in its own drama, and over time has demonstrated its inadequacy to cope with the challenges of preparing public school students to function effectively in a global 21st century environment.   That much is for sure.  Expecting improvement, by using the existing paradigm, is against all odds of success.  Thus, the impetus of most PK-14 state level, lobbyist-initiated reform measures or even a few grassroots/local level efforts  “aimed at solving problems and resolving issues” usually get weaker the longer they limp along and eventually die from apathy or as I refer to it “death by blandness.” These attempts at reform (while acknowledging that a few are initially well-intentioned efforts) amount to mere tweaking an outmoded paradigm.  Albeit, to those on the outside looking in, any effort aimed at change is perceived as a positive.<br/>I have reached this conclusion based on over five decades from both sides of an instructors’ desk as well as from career experience in a variety of educational situations: from special education programs designed for working with gifted students to working with students deemed  mentally challenged; from employment in more “traditional school settings” to a state penitentiary community college setting; from commitment to a K-12 parochial school environment to commitment to a K-12 public school environment; from teaching at-risk student athletes to teaching at-risk adults; from attending kindergarten-grammar school to finishing law school; from the perspective of a discontented teenage student to that of a more thoughtful adult instructor; and finally, to a more insightful professional administrator. <br/>Throughout the gamut of our my professional experience, I maintained a classroom instructor’s point of view with a mindset focused on identification of all aspects of instructional best practices: a) developing effective disciplinary strategies and time management tactics; b) utilizing appropriate methodological applications and delivery systems to enhance knowledge transfer; c) ensuring curriculum relevance in the content area; d) maintaining the highest level of course-content rigor; and finally, d) increasing human potential through reliable and valid performance measures of individual achievement.<br/>During the last twenty years, many national report cards that compare state-to-state data have found Alabama education practices and student achievement levels consistently below par.  Some claimed that where scarce resources exist for education, as is the case in Alabama’s Educational Trust Fund (ETF), funding inequities among all K-14 systems and Higher Education will continue.  Others argued, “Whether there has ever been enough revenue generated to adequately fund an ‘appropriate’ public education.”  However, for educational leadership to engage in continual turf battles and to quarrel over funding-level formulas is like paramedics performing triage on cadavers – it is an exercise in futility and fails to address more pressing long term needs. <br/>Our nation’s continued preeminence on the world stage is reliant on a superior-trained faculty cohort whose continuing professional development aims at implementing instructional best practices including the following:  a) employing effective classroom management as well as time management skills; b) understanding age appropriate social-psychological behavior; c) utilizing methodologies and technological delivery systems to accommodate diverse learning styles; d) adopting seamless web career counseling from early childhood; e) developing appropriate performance measures to gauge individual academic achievement; f) prescribing individual remediation measures; and g) developing dropout profiles that proactively focus on preventative interventions instead of prison as a last resort.  Even with recent, significant improvements in Alabama’s public schools, the evidence continues to demonstrate results that remain far from outstanding.  It should serve as a wake-up call to all:  What is going on inside our classrooms is serious business and failure to resolve recurring issues will have severe economic consequences.  Furthermore, although it is unfortunate and often contrary to reason, I believe that as long as the existing, paradigmatic framework continues to sustain the entrenched agenda of the status quo - - a genuine, authentic response to the problem shall remain an untenable reality.  Consequently, the objective of this report is to establish in the public consciousness the need for constructive dialogue among all stakeholders in an effort to validate the authenticity of perceived reality.  In other words, I propose a pilot program to accomplish on a small scale what I believe can and must be sustained on a large scale:  A New American School.   <br/>This study demonstrates those precise economic development linkage points that by necessity demand administrative leadership and accountability throughout the public education framework.  Moreover, the explicit recommendations in the accompanying Action Plan are not intended to infer a final destination; but rather, to point towards a new American school.   James Henley (Jim) Hethcox, J.D., Ed.D, MCP (April 9, 2009)<br/><br/>Overview<br/>The American education transfer process essentially entails the transfer of past generations’ culture, factual knowledge base, and core values.  The current public educational experience in the U.S. has its roots in the early 1900s.  The educational establishment solution to the problem of ensuring a large labor pool existed to meet increasing demands of industrial assembly lines was to design instructional programs that could mass-produce public school graduates.  Further complicating the problem was the integration into the workforce of not only an unskilled, semi-literate, homegrown cliental, but millions of non-English speaking immigrants as well.  <br/>It may or may not have been the best way to educate millions of non-English speaking Europeans; however, it could be argued that the then-existing educational establishment’s response to a burgeoning industrial sector’s insatiable demand for human resources was resourceful as well as a practical solution.  For example, the era between 1895-to-1939 overwhelmingly demonstrated the effectiveness of repetitive instructional programs designed to introduce age-related cohorts to a “minimum course of study.” The apparent success of that intervention, unfortunately, created a paradigm whose processes and systems have reified.<br/>Moreover, anachronistic policies and procedures that range from teacher credentialing to institutional accreditation are firmly entrenched.  The current myriad legislative funding processes and county or city or metro administrative systems are necessary and vital to support and maintain the establishment status quo which regrettably has little or no incentive to adapt and respond to a practical, resourceful solution to the unique requirements of yet unknown future circumstances.  <br/>Throughout the turmoil of the Great Depression, WW II, the baby boom, and racial integration, second and third generation immigrant families continued to assimilate through the local public and parochial school systems.  Given the fact that a century old solution to a then pressing workforce development problem is no longer relevant in our  current global economy, why do we continue to support and to maintain processes and systems that lethargically mass-produce students?  Why, given the tremendous advances in our understanding of cognitive development and computer technology, is the PK -14 educational transfer process virtually the same as it was in the 1960s?  Visit a PK-14 classroom during a lecture, if you don’t believe it.<br/>What if the emphasis on student testing mandated, albeit unfunded at the federal level, by NCLB has unintended consequences? For example, student achievement may soon become a euphemism for “meet and/or exceed group standardized test objectives,” rather than a valid and reliable measure of individual cognitive ability. Ironically, the dysfunction of the traditional public education paradigm may ultimately prove to be directly correlated with the increasing number of those who choose to opt-out, i.e., “drop-out.”  <br/>What if a portion of those students who opt-out are actually more perceptive, more demanding of content rigor, more inclined to think critically and challenge authority than those who placidly remain in their desks? What if opt-outs “pierce the veil” and perceive that the traditional school setting, by offering an extended childhood to all those willing to abide contentedly, nonetheless exhibits signs of a human-warehouse mechanism designed to maintain the nations’ labor pool at a consistent level?  What if, in addition to the poor learner or slow student, our nation is forfeiting its best and brightest-- a gifted segment? What if disgruntled opt-outs perceive concerted state efforts to “stay in school” amount to little more than coercive abuse of the states’ police power to mandate an intellectually boring, redundant, minimal program of study that by default punishes the non-conformist and anyone else who question its authenticity?<br/>Perhaps, to many parent/caregivers the conventional perception of education has been that it is something that happens to children and adolescents, and then finally, it is over - - with the beneficiary fully equipped to face adult life.  For decades, this was the conventional view of education that has held sway over not only caregivers; but also, policy makers in the United States.  Nevertheless, neither caregivers nor policy makers are engineers by profession and should not be expected to be aware of the typical engineering school dilemma, i.e., by the time graduates receive an engineering degree, approximately half of what they learned in the beginning has already become irrelevant (White House Science Council, 1986).<br/>Those on the economic development bandwagon inside the educational establishment seek to court industry through slick-finished, tri-fold brochures and resort to the use of buzzwords such as “continuing and lifelong education” or “competing in a global economy.”  What essential concepts lie behind the professional jargon?  What are the real implications?  If “continuing and lifelong” implies from cradle to grave, then continuing education courses are presently the best solution to the engineering school dilemma; in addition to maintaining proficiency among all professions.  However, such phrases have serious implications including the way in which traditional instructional delivery systems operate and the manner in which curriculum innovations are designed to more closely parallel the unique needs of 21st century public and private sector employers as well as the students they seek to employ.  In the face of mounting obstacles to remain competitive, clichés are only the answer if one is satisfied with counterfeit gestures and public posturing.  Furthermore, if the proper questions are not posed to decision makers and policy wonks, then what difference does it make which answers they spin?<br/>If we are not willing to admit the present system’s unequivocal inability to perform at an acceptable level, then it is highly unlikely we shall be willing to take vital measures necessary to arrive at the next level.  It is a truism that only when an individual hits bottom can meaningful change and rehabilitation begin.  Perhaps that holds true for institutions as well.  For too long, the armed forces and private-sector employers have had to spend billions per year to (re)train recent graduates simply to perform basic skills.  Faced with mounting operating cost, the day will come when employers will finally balk at funding a sole, state-operated enterprise that fails to deliver warranted merchandise.  Consequently, further analysis and/or recommendations, by legislatively appointed either blue ribbon committees or executive appointed commissions, of policies, programs, and initiatives shall no longer be seen as a sign that “help is on the way.”   <br/>While high schools must be held accountable for the lack of college and workplace readiness among their graduates, unprepared students represent a failure of the entire PK-16 system -- -- a dysfunctional academic pipeline with weak standards and misaligned policies.  Policy makers have long approached the high school and higher education systems as independent entities, whose practices do whose practices do not impinge on one another.  This is even true at the federal level, where most education legislation focuses on either K-12 or higher education (Boser, Ulrich and Burd, Stephen, 2009).   <br/>Since the late 1980s, foreign nationals increasingly have enroll at American colleges and universities rather than choosing to matriculate at any other countries’ higher education institutions, including their own.  The irony is that American PK-14 student achievement scores indicate skills that are sorely lacking compared to other developed nations who send their better academically-prepared child to benefit from our superior, research-oriented, Tier 1 institutions.  As a consequence, the more the public demands from Pk-12, the higher the expectation becomes, until the teaching profession is at a lost to explain lack of “student performance” except to point towards the “Fruit not falling far from the tree” theory of HRD.  In any event and regardless of who is to blame, a direct results of the consequences of our cumulative behavior has become our shame:    As HRD dries up and dies on the vine, so does our ability to invent and innovate.<br/>Our nation needs citizens that have been prepared to be productive. Yet one-third of students who enter the ninth grade never graduate from high school. Clearly, the United States cannot accept a 33 percent failure rate if it is to keep pace economically and militarily (SREB, 2007).<br/><br/>Billions of scarce dollars are wasted on postsecondary student remediation in a bizarre attempt to academically prepare them to attend two year college or state and land grant institutions.  Unfortunately, after all the time, money, and energy spent to remediate unprepared American students approximately twenty per cent (20%) of entering freshman will complete a degree program in seven years (NCES, 2005).<br/>This dysfunctional, 19th Century paradigm continues to distort what should be public educations’ essential mission in the 21st Century - - human capital, formerly conceived as man-hour mass labor, now transformed by the burgeoning demands for knowledge workers.  Conscious development of an individual’s unique potential joined to others flowing through a process-pipeline of human resource development activities then finally, pouring over a spillway - - out into a vast reservoir . . . a pool of human talent.  <br/>If the locomotive that drives the train of a state’s economic development is higher education, then its effectiveness demands a more comprehensive role involving higher education in the entire educational process from kindergarten through graduate school.  Resolving the issue of how to proceed with such an arrangement involves posing the fundamental question -- What is the purpose of public education?  <br/>The posing of that particular question by enough concerned individuals shall establish the initial motivation for beginning a process that leads to strategic planning.  A successful strategic plan, when implemented embodies future aspirations in the form of goals and objectives.  Each advance is a necessary step to achieve the missions’ purpose.  Finally, parents, students, and all other stakeholders/ grandparents /interested parties/ employers, i.e., industry, small business owners, local government, must demand a blueprint for a new American school.  With the goal of such a blueprint in mind, let us consider our weakest lynchpin, the perilous nexus whereby PK-14 fails to connect fully with the end link - - American higher education institutions.<br/><br/>Strategic Decision Model<br/>Proof of well-conceived strategic decisions is most amply demonstrated  when tactical decisions integrate with operational decisions, so that as a natural consequence, the strategic vision that set the process in motion is “in sync” with reality, instead of being stretched over reality like an ill-fitting bed sheet.  Consequently, our purpose should act as a compass to provide direction so that our mental map not only absorbs a comprehension of the whole; but is able to conceive an insight into the most advantageous tactical and operational directives that will guide us successfully to our destination, i.e., demonstrate the means necessary for initiating specific goals in order to obtain desired results.  <br/>A proper purpose must be derived from an honest examination of perceived strengths and weaknesses that informs the total educational design process.  The most crucial factor in the entire design process centers on whether its collaborators / authors shall have the resolve to be able to successfully initiate, execute, and complete the action plan portion of the strategic plan.  It is solely the responsibility of the leadership to acknowledge:  Whether the entire community prospers or fails to prosper shall ultimately be determined by the leaderships’ ability to anticipate the long-term needs, to identify all available resources, and to develop human capital to meet those needs in order to be able even to compete in a 21st Century global economy.<br/>Moreover, if the first round of discussion leads to proposed changes that prove too great a challenge for the existing system to implement, then the leadership is duty-bound to be adaptable, retrench and anticipate where remaining interests exist to overcome remaining differences, and be able to adopt another plan and place it on the examination table.  If that examination proves fruitful, then let that mandate be the call to action.  The following model exemplifies that goal:<br/>	Strategic Decisions: Establish the major parameters for organizational effort and generally answer the question - - What are we going to do?<br/>	Tactical Decisions: Derived from strategic decisions (above) and help answer the question - - How are we going to do it?<br/>	Operational Decisions: Establish procedures and answers the question- - Who will do what?<br/>(Chaffee, 1983)<br/>Thus, the responsibility for initiating and executing the recommended actions of a strategic plan falls on the leadership.  Finally, it is critical to the success of our mission that we become more conscious of the value of language’s precision and accuracy i.e., “terms of art” to describe the educational characteristics that drive the strategic plan.<br/>•	Paradigm - A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality for the community that shares them, especially in an intellectual discipline.<br/>•	Process Innovation is the act of engagement in basic research, distribution of findings, and assistance to anyone whose applied research interests is in using those findings i.e., converting them into a useful concept/product/service.<br/>•	Process Innovation Pipeline Completion Cycle – a collaborative group action similar to the Manhattan Project that involves 1) performing basic research from conception to dispersal of findings, and 2) using applied research skills in order to convert basic research findings into a concept that provides a product or service useful to a niche market. <br/>•	Imagineer – a highly skilled person in process innovation professionally trained to marshal required forces through a completion cycle pipeline in order to meet established group goals and team objectives.<br/>All of the following educational characteristics are referenced in terms of a distinctive American educational paradigm:<br/>•	Framework – a reified, institutional apparatus that lobbies for the status quo.<br/>•       Process – a legislatively, legally-appropriated, publicly-funding scheme designed to foster the goals and objectives of interests vested in the preservation of the status quo.<br/>•	System – by and large, a chain of command, administratively-driven,	organizational reaction to allocate formerly appropriated tax dollars ostensibly	to make available a professional, instructional, public agenda that, among other	things, seeks to assimilate the desires inherently a part of American social	change, patched together for over a century, and is most often referred to as (or	poses as) education.<br/>•	HRD - Human Resource Development (HRD), more aptly characterizes what most really mean when referring to education. The term Human Resource Development (HRD), more aptly characterizes what most people really mean when referring to education.  Consequently, HRD involves integration of four essential elements inherent in the human maturation process (PK-16) that include the following:<br/>1.	a highly-trained, nurturing professional skilled at enabling an individual to achieve means to discover their own potential, <br/>2.	a societal comprehension and appreciation of each and every individual's potentially, unique contribution, <br/>3.	an innovative system and process that facilitates HRD by utilizing the existing public education framework, where possible, in the most appropriate, efficient manner, and <br/>4.	a local dedication to inculcate the value of the rigorous approach required for sustaining a life-long and continuing, cradle-to-grave,  personal commitment to knowledge acquisition.<br/><br/>Introduction<br/>By the end of summer 1969, The United States of America had executed the plan to put human beings on the moon within the decade.  Fourteen years later, a challenge no less daunting was raised when the findings from A Nation at Risk (1983) confronted the educational establishment and launched a media blitz to reform our public schools.  Although the sense of urgency that prompted the original report has subsided, be assured the risk posed then is just as menacing now.   <br/>Alabama has made significant increases in its commitment to education in recent years with its overall education budget growing by approxi¬mately 50 percent between 2000 and 2006.  Most of the state’s current workers, however, did not have the opportunity to benefit from these investments.  More than half a million Alabamians between the ages of 18 and 64 remain caught in the education gap, lacking a high school diploma or a GED.  Ala¬bama’s educational system has failed to equip these workers with the skills and certifications neces¬sary to compete in today’s global economy.  And for many other Alabamians, education ended with high school graduation; less than one-third of all adults between the ages of 25 and 54 have an associate’s degree or higher.14 With the workplace becoming more complex, and employers demanding higher skill levels, many of these workers will be unable to compete in the job market without additional education and training. Until Alabama renews its commitment to education and training for adults, a basic education gap likely will persist for four decades or longer, until today’s 25-year-olds retire.  (Bridging the Gap, 2008, emphasis mine)<br/><br/>It is again time to examine the progress of our public schools.  However, it is past time for the public to demand accountability. Moreover, the Arise Citizens’ Policy Project entitled, Bridging the Gap 2009, focuses on an unwieldy, PK-16 system and emphasizes remediation efforts to address underlying factors pressuring the dropout issue and the apparent discrepancy of public educations’ inability to prepare students to succeed in a post secondary environment (Boser and Burd, 2009).   <br/>A critical examination of the education framework, process, and system associated with our children’s future, its impact on our collective survival in a global economy, and the increasing frustration over moral, ethical, legal, academic issues that confound it continue to be a worthy topic for consideration.   Whatever else ails American education, in general, and Alabama education, in particular, it should be understood from the outset that the existing educational framework comprised of the funding process and administrative system that it supports, is not broken – but rather designed to deliver mass-produce training to perform low-to-mid level skills.  It simply has been inoculated with repeated doses of status quo; and as a consequence, has become totally resistant to real change other than faddish counterfeits posing as innovation.  <br/>Moreover, national, state, and local efforts continually aiming at improving education often are at cross-purposes over where to focus their reform-minded initiatives or precisely what must be done. What must be done cannot be done “on top of the existing” or “integrated into the present model.” What must be done involves integration of content and facilities to inculcate values that emphasize and cherish character development, critical thinking, problem solving, team work, competitive-cooperation, and above all --- self-esteem.  What can be done involves a personal commitment of the community’s leadership to initiate the first steps in that direction:  developing a prototype that moves us closer Towards a New American School.<br/><br/>Statement of the Problem<br/>At the state level, a legislative mechanism that serves primarily as a funding source legally appropriating the scarce dollars that are to be allocated for educating our children through a local school system.  the funding process evolved into Some perceive the “system” as a reified institutional entity, i.e., the State Department of Education in Montgomery or the main office building where the superintendent works with other administrators and staff.  Others might perceive the same system comprised of myriad individuals that daily care for students inside thousands of hallways, lunchrooms, band rooms, basketball courts, and classrooms across Alabama.  Essentially, each perspective is value-laden and offers insight into the underlying principles relevant to the publics’ perception of “actors in the ongoing drama.”<br/>The framework defines an alignment of the process and the system to direct a revenue stream from the public tax coffers to be dispersed according to legislatively binding spending measures, and then allocated to the recipients or local school authority (LEA).  Since teaching is such a labor-intensive profession, approximately eighty percent (80%) to eighty-five (85%) of all funding goes towards employee wages and benefits with any remaining to fund the rest.  It should be noted:  Faculty have little direct input and absolutely no legal authority over the dispersal of funding. <br/>Economic development in the 21st century begins with an entrepreneur seeking a readily available, high-skilled, adaptive, pool of human-resource capital.  In fact, of the seven emerging roles of higher education's involvement in economic development described in a comprehensive review of the literature, human capital, broadly defined as targeted human-resource development (HRD), was the most important (Hethcox, 1990).  The definition of  Human Capital has been expressed in a variety of  ways.  Depending on who is the beneficiary, human capital might be expressed in terms of a commodity (emphasized as a cost of labor) or HRD as a capital investment in knowledge acquisition ie., providing employee opportunities to a seamless education.  Decision makers must be willing to acknowledge commitment to capital investment in HRD with its purse, i.e., incentives offered for demonstrated evidence of best practices of instruction in an information-based global economy.  Finally, the Wye Plantation Conference in Eastern Shore, MD, identified four major general resource development trends bearing on higher education: <br/>1.	the needs of students,<br/>2.	the delivery of information, <br/>3.	the organization of knowledge, and <br/>4.	the relationship of higher education to economic development.<br/>The conference conclusion found that changing demographics meant academia must adjust to continuing, lifelong education of nontraditional students (Preer, 1984). Twenty-five years later, what significant adjustments have been made in teaching teachers or in student/faculty performance evaluations or in curricula innovations or in the manner in which knowledge is dispensed that seeks to accommodate those nontraditional students who increasingly choose to opt-out?  Perhaps, the essential difference between the more successful as opposed to those who are not lies in the eyes of the beholder to determine whether education is perceived as an investment or as an expense.<br/><br/>The Target in an Information Based Society:<br/>Human Resource Development <br/>Since WWII, successful universities’ have distinguished themselves by an ability to adapt to an information-based global economy. Higher education, administrative, institutional cultures’ ability to maintain flexibility was related directly to the way it perceives HRD:<br/>1)	With respect to what constitutes scholarly activity in light of increasing pedagogical demands on faculty;<br/>2)	With regard to format, location, and timing of instruction;<br/>3)	In response to external demands regarding new courses and curriculum; and <br/>4)	With regard to potential faculty collaboration with industry, government, and community needs.<br/>The model of a modern university requires faculty to be in active contact with the world outside academia.  If colleges and universities are to engage in economic development activities such as capacity building, technical assistance, technology transfer, human resource development, then faculty effort towards those ends must be rewarded.  Although public service was the backbone of economic development at the local level, most faculty members believe that their public service activities were not rewarded.  Furthermore, there were no mechanisms for measuring the amount of public service in higher education, no longitudinal studies of service activity, and no studies that linked reward systems and public service.  Consequently, under the existing paradigm little institutional reward promotes faculty involvement in economic development activities.<br/>In addition, few universities advocated rewarding faculty activity that: (a) created new knowledge, (b) trained others in their discipline or area of expertise, (c) interpreted aggregate-knowledge to make it more understandable and useful, and (d) disseminated knowledge to the appropriate audience.  Under the present tenure and promotion system, faculty is rewarded for contributions to the research literature in professional journals.  However, faculty are neither rewarded for synthesizing that literature in forms that might be useful to others, nor for providing policy analysis to industry, nor for developing applications of research to practical problems, nor for delivering technical assistance to either emerging or established industries, and especially not meaningfully rewarded for excellence in teaching.  Outside of medicine and other hard sciences, this anachronistic university policy should have been challenged decades ago. <br/>Another major aspect of human resource development that went beyond traditional postsecondary education and training activities and yet proved indicative of the need for higher education to adapt to the changing demographics of an adult student population was the issue of childcare (AASCU, 1986; Osborne, 1987).<br/>Today, mothers of half of the children one year of age and under are at work.  Most of these women need to and will stay at work.  They and their families require good childcare.  Only 1,800 of our six million employers provide such assistance in any form such as employee benefits, on-site care, or financing.  (Choate cited in AASCU, 1986, p. 17)  As a result of changing American lifestyles, more children were entering school from: "single-parent households; minority backgrounds; poverty households; teen-age mothers; Asian-American backgrounds with increasing language difficulties; and Hispanic backgrounds with a 40% high school drop out rate" (Hodgkinson, 1985, p. 10).  <br/><br/>The severity of social and economic consequences for failure to ameliorate eroding human resource losses has prompted states to examine ways to expand and improve childcare (Osborne, 1987).  Reich (1988) estimated 20% of American 18-year-olds are functionally illiterate, and 25% drop out of high school before graduating and he acknowledged that this was not the sort of population likely to generate high productivity in the future (pp. 526-527).  Postsecondary strategies of intervention were restricted by the nature of their mission, role, and scope; however, a viable community/technical college response might include offering workfare subsidized, on-campus day care facilities to students' children, and state and local subsidies to faculty, staff, and other students who qualify.  <br/>In addition, colleges of education could provide local pre-school programs a source for undergraduate practice teaching, graduate internships, and research grant opportunities to evaluate effective curricula and teaching methodologies, and to analyze early childhood learning behaviors: especially those related to disabilities and other aspects of rehabilitative special education. Thus, an approach to an institutional mission that fulfilled public service, teaching, and research responsibilities while addressing an urgent economic development and human resource need prompted this innovative response:<br/>Provide a pre-school program for families of faculty, staff, and students.<br/>The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES, 2000) compiles high school completion rates for the nation.  These completion rates represent the proportion of 18- through 24-year-olds, not currently enrolled in high school or below, who have completed a high school diploma or an equivalent credential, including a General Educational Development (GED) credential.  The data reveals that<br/>♦ In 2000, 86.5 percent of all 18- through 24-year-olds not enrolled in high school had completed high school.  Completion rates rose slightly from the early 1970s to the late 1980s, but have remained fairly constant during the 1990s; <br/>♦ High school completion rates increased for White and Black young adults between the early 1970s and late 1980s, but have remained relatively constant in the 1990s; and<br/>♦ By 2000, 91.8 percent of White and 83.7 percent of Black 18- through 24-year-olds had completed high school.<br/>A more recent study builds upon a series of National Center for Education Statistics (NCES, 2005) reports on high school dropout and completion rates that began in 1988.  It presents estimates of rates in 2005, provides data about trends in dropout and completion rates over the last three decades (1972–2005), and examines the characteristics of high school dropouts and high school completers in 2005.  Four rates, “contributing unique information”, purportedly presented to provide a broad picture of high school dropouts and completers in the United States; instead demonstrate what might be more aptly characterized as obfuscating the essential with the tangential.<br/><br/>Again, NCES demonstrated that dropping out of high school is related to a number of negative outcomes.  For example, the average income of persons ages 18 through 65 who had not completed high school was roughly $20,100 in 2005.  By comparison, the average income of person’s ages 18 through 65 who completed their education with a high school credential, including a General Educational Development (GED) certificate, was nearly $29,700.  Dropouts are also less likely to be in the labor force than those with a high school credential or higher and are more likely to be unemployed if they are in the labor force.  In terms of health, dropouts older than age 24 tend to report being in worse health than adults who are not dropouts, regardless of income (NCES, 2005).  <br/>Dropouts also make up disproportionately higher percentages of the nation’s prison and death row inmates.  Again, this is far from the sort of population likely to generate high productivity in the future (NCES, 2005).  Postsecondary strategies of intervention have been restricted by the nature of their mission, roll, and scope; however, a viable community / technical college response might include offering workfare subsidized, on-campus day-care facilities to students’ children, and state and local subsidies to faculty, staff, and other students who qualify.  In addition, colleges of education PK programs could provide a source for undergraduate practice teaching, graduate internships, and research grant opportunities to evaluate effective curricula and teaching methodologies, and to analyze early childhood learning behaviors: especially those related to disabilities and other aspects of rehabilitative special education -- for example, the equestrian learning experience at the Alabama School for the Deaf and Blind (AIDB) in Talladega, Alabama.<br/>A flexible response by academia to external demands regarding periodic reevaluation of new courses and curricula should be based on objective data that reflect the particular mission of the institution with respect to its role in human resource development.  For example, the expansion of foreign trade in economic development has increased the role of postsecondary education in human resource development (Osborne, 1987).  In particular, core instruction in international studies and promotion of foreign language requirements were cited most often as examples that effectively prepared students to cope with a global economy (AASCU, 1986; Choate & Linger, 1986; Doyle & Brisson, 1985; Levine, 1984; NEBHE, 1987).  Although there were similar recommendations to strengthen the undergraduate core curriculum at the University of Maryland in 1981, it is even more appropriate in 2009 to advocate their inclusion in a senior high school curriculum in anticipation of college:<br/>Promote a foreign language requirement.<br/>Promote international studies that enhance knowledge of other cultures as a core requirement.<br/>Conduct a year abroad foreign exchange program.<br/>In the past, it was widely assumed that upon completion of a college education it was time to move on to the real world and to apply that knowledge; however, the increasingly rapid pace of technological change has made such a view totally unacceptable (WHSC, 1986, p. 27).  For example, the half-life of an engineer's knowledge is thought to be three to five years (AASCU, 1986, p. 12) and implied the need for closer university-industry collaboration in continuing education with regard to curricula review and development. <br/>Also, the current use of pedagogic methodologies is not conducive to adequate preparation of students for coping with problems in the face of rapid technological change (Choate & Linger, 1986; Levin, 1984; Li, 1980).  For example, Kerr and Pipes argued that the crises in engineering education was a result of the emphasis placed on engineering science to develop basic knowledge at the expense of engineering design which entailed devising a system or process to meet desired needs (1987, pp. 37-38).  Sample (1988) contended that being considered educated in America today demanded fluency in two languages--English and calculus.  He concluded the concept of whole-person education, far from being a romantic notion was a necessity, "These times cry out for truly liberal and truly integrative education, both in the arts and sciences and in the undergraduate professional curricula" (Sample, 1988, p. 56).  <br/>Furthermore, Tucker (1983), in a paper presented at the National Conference on Higher Education entitled Reflections on Retooling America for Economic Growth through Investments in Higher Education, advocated educating nor just more engineers, but rather more engineers who are creative and broadly educated enough to tackle confidently quite unfamiliar problems.  Tucker noted university efforts to respond to development of new fields of knowledge often cut across the old,<br/>it adds interdisciplinary structures (institutes, laboratories, centers, and so on) that do not replace the old [departmental] structure, but are rather layered on above it. . . .  But it is precisely in these interdisciplinary structures that students stand the best chance of working on large technical projects and on unconventional problems with a lot of colleagues in relatively flat organizational structures.  Emphasis mine (1983, p. 5) <br/>Consequently, if American engineering education intends to continue to be a vital part of economic growth through technological advancement, then curriculum changes to overcome lack of creativity and a practical sense of intervention to anticipate public needs are prerequisites for the engineering graduate of tomorrow.  In this context, Parameter Analysis was born. <br/>What is Parameter Analysis?<br/>Professor Li, in Technological Innovation in Education and Industry, argued that while content knowledge may become obsolete, comprehension of innovation developed entrepreneurship. He advocated a methodology to instruct a population that found it difficult to verbalize - undergraduate engineering students.  Li proposed a solution that sought to educate engineers through an interdisciplinary study approach and subsequent assessment through case study analysis.  He described a classroom methodology that enhanced understanding of innovation and promoted entrepreneurship, called parameter analysis.  Parameter analysis imitated the innovation process, i.e., a creative endeavor involving continual selection, analysis, evaluation, and synthesis:<br/>Creative writing, music composition, dance, and athletics are taught in schools, even though achievement in each activity hinges heavily on individual talent.  By contrast, in the conventional curriculum of engineering and management schools, very few courses emphasize developing creativity in invention and entrepreneurship.  Emphasis Mine (Li, 1980, p. 23) <br/>In addition to Parameter Analysis, methodology advocating interdepartmental cooperation that combined case studies with problem solving simulations.  In order to promote problem solving, Li (1980) advocated multiple perspectives gained from multidisciplinary study and emphasized the importance of creativity in addition to content knowledge.  His recommendations for enhancing student problem solving included:<br/>Encourage undergraduate interdepartmental studies, and<br/>Devise instructional methodologies across curricula that utilize multidisciplinary case studies in combination with problem solving simulations.<br/>Other methodological strategies to promote understanding of the innovation process included conflict strategy models (Schelling, 1960), and multiple scenarios based on conceptual simulations (Allison, 1971).  Advocates of conceptual models of a modern university insisted on the explicit recognition of the role of technology in science and industry and suggested the result of the separation of the two would be counter-productive for both (National Academy of Engineering Science, 1985).  <br/>Yet, in spite of the increased need for innovation, educational researchers who lack practical insight, continue to naively recommend a creative application of new perspective be layered on top of the existing framework, so that a finding “to encourage academic policy that requires multidisciplinary graduate study within the framework of traditional departments” (Hethcox, 1990) actually discounts the traditional university departments’ propensity to adopt change with malice; and thus, stymie authentic efforts to stimulate lasting innovation.    In spite of academia’s efforts to stymie change in higher education administration policies, procedures and practices, occasionally evidence demonstrates that technological advances will erode such resistance if it can offer significant financial incentives to do so<br/>Besides methodological changes in how we teach, new fields of study have emerged as a result of space exploration, advanced medical technology, and applications of computer science to other fields that have implications regarding what we teach.  For example, the application of principles in computer science and management created a new field whose purpose was to manage and apply information systems (IS) technology.  As a result IS has emerged as one of the most prolific management areas (AASCU, 1986). <br/>Interestingly, unlike higher education, industry resistance to the status quo is counter balanced to some degree by competition, so that future entrepreneurial Davids can continue to overcome Goliaths.   For example, in 1986 Microsoft went public and in combination with upstart Apple, eventually ended the era of mainframes and the domination of IBM.  <br/>In fact, the White House Science Council reported "the most exciting and fruitful research opportunities are to be found in the interface areas between the traditional disciplines" and encouraged federal funding to enhance multidisciplinary activities within the universities (Klingman & Phillips, 1988). (See Appendix 2 for a more full treatment of issues surrounding interdisciplinary studies in 2009).  In addition to collaboration with industry and government, Lynton and Elman included community collaboration as well (1987, p. 110).  Rolzinski defined community in terms of economic development that included "planning and implementing programs to improve the economic well-being of people within their social context" (1986, p. 90).<br/><br/>As higher education institutions increase emphasis on economic development, the challenge of collaborative arrangements with business, organized labor, government, and community organizations presented unique problems considering the range of learner needs (Rolzinski, 1986, p. 93).  She noted, at its most basic level, collaboration involved a single academic community working with a single business community, adult community, or labor community, and at its most advanced level, collaboration involved many organizational communities (1986, p. 93).  The traditional roles of academia to collect and examine data and to explore ways of stating problems were valuable skills in helping community groups perceive how to develop the best possible strategies to mitigate large economic forces that affected them (Rolzinski, 1986, pp. 94-95).  <br/>In addition, the traditional human resource development role of academia made it an ideal capacity-building mechanism for helping community organizations define their own problems and find unique solutions (AASCU, 1986).  Some institutions found that they could further contribute to community economic development efforts by encouraging collaboration of diverse groups through university-sponsored programs on a wide range of topics, such as advanced technology, exporting, new business development and raised these items of higher education human resource efforts aimed at community needs:<br/>Establish advisory councils and other linkage mechanisms to keep in touch with community needs (AASCU, 1986, p. 48).<br/>Build capacity through symposia and conferences involving diverse community groups including business, labor, and local government leaders and faculty to address economic development priorities (AASCU, 1986, p. 16).<br/>Educate policy makers and the general public about university resources that could promote local economic development (Doyle & Brisson, 1985, p. 18).<br/>Why are administrators slow to act, if in fact for decades, the White House Science Council has encouraged federal funding to enhance multidisciplinary activity within the university?  Research indicates that behemoth institutions, i.e., the church, government, public schools, etc. are historically slow to act to make any change.  Consequently, a key principle inherent in many vast, bureaucratic, institution’s inability to influence meaningful policy directives (such as those involved in a state’s education appropriation or course transfer processes) is typically characterized by fierce, well-organized, resistance to any change that would disrupt the status quo.  What is their underlying concern?  <br/>Some have argued that such is the nature of a bureaucratic, plantation mentality; some claim inept administrators or powerful teacher unions are to blame; while still others blame either a left-or-right wing conspiracy depending on their personal political bias.  More than likely, it is a combination of factors that may or may not include all the above.  Application of Occam’s razor infers the answer is simply that no genuine impetus exists within the organization for systemic change.  Perhaps, the more astute administrator perceives any pronounced deviance from the status quo is an unnecessarily foolish risk to career advancement already fraught with considerable unknowns.  Thus, incentives should be implemented that would make it worth the career risks for administrators to propose innovation and for faculty (and all other significant stakeholders) to accept responsibility for its execution.<br/>As higher education institutions increase emphasis on economic development, the challenge of collaborative agreements with business, organized labor, government, and community organizations presented unique problems considering the range of learner needs.  In addition to collaboration with industry and government, community collaboration should also be included.  At its most basic level, collaboration involved a single academic community working with a single business community, adult community, or labor community, and at its most advanced level, collaboration involved many organizational communities.  In terms of economic development, community collaboration included planning and implementing programs to improve the economic well being of people within their social context. <br/>The traditional roles in academia to collect and examine data and to explore ways of stating problems were valuable skills in helping community groups perceive how to develop the best possible strategies to mitigate large economic forces that affected them.  In addition, the traditional human resource development role in academia made it an ideal capacity building mechanism for helping community organizations define their own problems and find unique solutions.  Some postsecondary institutions found that they could further contribute to community economic development efforts by encouraging collaboration of diverse groups through University-sponsored programs on a wide range of topics, such as:  practical application of advanced technology in nurturing new business development, i.e., exporting.  These efforts should include the most appropriate methodologies as well as the most efficient delivery systems to transfer that knowledge to intended end-users. <br/><br/>New American School<br/>I propose a New American School.  It would be a hybrid based on an expansion of the post-WW I Bauhaus concept and Lockheed’s Skunk Works research & design model.  The primary mission of a New American School is do no harm to those entrusted to our care for cognitive development.  The goal of a New American School is creation of an environment that fosters innovation and promotes the unique characteristic-set pertinent to human inspiration; and especially, the quality of earned respect which is vital to development of authentic self-esteem.  Upon these two uniquely, genuine human responses – inspiration and self esteem, success of such a program relies. In order to accomplish these goals a New American School seeks to integrate the concept of form follows function by recognition of the influence that physical facilities have on the social interactive environment and its subsequent impact on human resource development. The singular initiative of a New American School is the promotion, growth, and development of a new kind of engineer – an Imagineer or one who is skilled in the process innovation pipeline completion cycle.  A process innovation pipeline completion cycle requires a collaborative group action similar to the Manhattan Project that involves marshaling all forces necessary in 1) performing basic research from conception to dispersal of findings, and 2) using applied research skills in order to convert basic research findings into a concept that provides a product or service useful to a niche market.  (See Appendices 7 & 8 for a more full treatment of the subject)<br/>Conclusion<br/>Several aspects of the increased importance of the critical role of higher education and PK-14 in human resource development have been noted.  Innovation that encouraged change was the major theme in the literature underlying the PK-14 and higher education partnership where the most successful engagements of economic development occurred at the regional, state, and local levels.  Change that reflected the small, incremental steps in perception that are essential, in the early stages of the innovation process as the prevailing paradigm shifts to another.  Interestingly, the predominant source of change initially was rarely due to any professional organization or trade association; but rather by a single advocate who painstakingly nurtured enduring change, i.e., a change agent or a champion.  Change of that type fosters economic development and includes the following:<br/>	Changes in administrative attitudes toward faculty;<br/>	Changes in administrative perspectives of student needs with regard to format, to location, and to timing of instruction; and<br/>	Changes in the organization of knowledge.<br/>As with most behemoth social institutions, except for cosmetic changes, real change is relatively rare.  It can be argued that administrators, at all levels, are slow to become an agent of change because there is a negative incentive to do so, i.e., charting new directions into the unknown as opposed to maintaining the status quo is rationally perceived as an unnecessary risk to career advancement.  Consequently, if there is no impetus from within the organization for systemic change, then by necessity, pressure from outside the traditional avenues should and must make those demands on behalf of those beneficiaries whose trust fund has been violated.  <br/>In other words, real change means a charting a new course utilizing meaningful reports based on accurate, reliable data; rather than on, vendettas, ego-driven turf battles, and stale political agendas.  It means focusing on the issues that stretch out directly in front of us rather than facing backwards walking into the future because “that’s the way things always have been done.”  Attempting to apply lipstick to a pig-snout is not only counterproductive; it delays what posterity demands - - the social, economic, and political courage to implement genuine change regarding the manner in which this nation conducts the enterprise of teaching the adults of tomorrow.  Consequently, all involved in rebuilding a 21st century educational framework must possess the intellectual integrity to be able to acknowledge the substantial difference between cosmetic changes merely for the sake of appearance as opposed to authentic innovation.  The former rightly complain of the exorbitant expense while the latter willingly acknowledge the wise investment. <br/>References<br/><br/>Allison, G. (1971).

This would create new jobs in teaching and invest in education and keep U.S. Dollars here and not sending them overseas.
