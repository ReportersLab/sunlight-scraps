<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">To ensure civic participation, privacy should be a top concern.  Consumers expect the privacy and security of their data.  And the government should not violate federal privacy, data security and wiretap laws well as corresponding rules applicable to government agencies.  Numerous federal and state laws require government to maintain both the confidentiality and the protection of certain data, so IT solutions must be "government ready" by these criteria.  Ensuring the privacy and security of data will increase consumer confidence and trust in the way data is handled by government and non-government actors alike.  We cannot gamble public trust on IT solutions that have an open door to bad actors or that have unnecessary risks that would lead to even lower levels of civic engagement.<br/> </div>

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">According to government agencies themselves, every year federal departments and agencies cite roughly 140 statutes to deny thousands of requests for information; our coalition (the Sunshine in Government Initiative) estimates that more than 240 are on the books.  The agencies themselves are often the originators of these new legislative loopholes.<br/><br/>Recommendation:  Any new statutory exemptions proposed or supported by the Obama administration should be limited in scope and life and include oversight.  The Obama administration should prohibit agencies from proposing new Exemption 3 statutes unless agencies determine that:<br/><br/>1.  Existing statutory protections and exemptions within FOIA are not adequate<br/>2.  The interest in withholding is specific and articulated<br/>3.  The interest in withholding clearly is greater than the public interest in disclosure<br/>4.  The exemption is publicly disclosed at the time it is proposed<br/><br/>Further, any new proposals that meet the above criteria should be crafted narrowly to limit harm to the free flow of information.  Specifically, each new proposal under Exemption 3 should:<br/><br/>1.  Clearly state its purpose and explain why the existing exemptions are inadequate<br/>2.  Be narrowly drafted so as not to exceed the specific non-disclosure needs compelling the exemption<br/>3.  Provide for public reporting that measures the efficacy of the exemption in achieving its stated goals<br/>4.  Offers alternative and equivalent means of public oversight<br/>5.  Have a built-in sunset provision<br/>6.  Clearly state in the text of the statute that the proposal is not intended to inhibit whistle blowing<br/>7.  Ensure any penalties for improper decisions in carrying out the statute are themselves balanced and without favor to withholding or disclosure<br/></div>

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">Dear Mr. President,<br/><br/>Please direct the DEA to remove marijuana from Schedule I and correctly classify it under the definitions that the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) provides.  You said in your press conference (after you released the ban on federal funds for stem-cell research) that you believed that science should dictate policy not politics and I respectfully request that you follow through with this pledge even on something so politically toxic as marijuana.<br/><br/>Schedule I of the CSA specifically states that in order to be placed in this schedule I that the substance in question must have "no accepted medical use for treatment in the United States."  Well... as of 1996 there are states that have accepted the medicinal uses of marijuana for treatment.  Currently there are 13 states that have ACCEPTED the medical use for treatment therefore the current scheduling goes against the definition that was put into place.<br/><br/>In 1970, when the CSA was established there were NO accepted uses for treatment in the US, so the initial scheduling was correct.  In 1988, when Administrative Law Judge Francis Young ruled that the DEA was required to reclassify marijuana there again were no states that had accepted the use for treatment and therefore the DEA had due cause to ignore the recommendation.  But after California ACCEPTED the medical use for treatment in 1996 the Scheduel I classification became incorrect soley based on the definition.<br/><br/>Why does the Federal Government currently provide Medical Marijuana to 4 citizens of the United States for treatment of their illnesses while upholding the classification under "no medical use for treatment"?  Isn't this a little hypocritical???</div>

That means no more signing statements rewriting laws, and instead support for legislation that would criminalize such behavior.  And it means similar action on each of the other offenses.  <br/><br/>We, the people, must:<br/><br/>Demand that Congress ban the use of funds for any activities created in violation of the law by presidential signing statements.<br/><br/>Amend the Constitution to clearly ban the use of presidential pardons to pardon crimes authorized by the president.<br/><br/>Amend the War Powers Act and the Constition to include the requirement that Congressional authorizations of war include time limits of no more than 12 months, after which Congress must vote again to extend the war or end it, to disallow the unconstitutional initiation of wars without Congressional approval, and to make the law enforceable.<br/><br/>Make war profiteering by any war maker a major felony.

Break up the monopolies.  Invest in public media, including an E-Span election network to provide free substantive election coverage.<br/><br/>Advance a long-term vision in which the corrupting influences of money, media, and party are restrained, and our rights are restored, enforced, and expanded, including the right to vote and to have our votes counted publicly and locally, equal rights for all, environmental rights, the right to education and healthcare, worker rights, the right to basic welfare, freedom of press, freedom from war lies, and the right to know your rights.  <br/><br/>Push for approval, ratification, and enforcement of international human rights treaties.  Build toward Constitutional amendments or a convention with a plan to establish the right to know the laws and to have them applied equally, a ban on signing statements, whistleblowers protected, inherent contempt established, corporations stripped of human rights, monopolies restricted, clean campaign money and free media created, the power of parties reduced, nonpartisan (not bipartisan) redistricting, limiting election seasons, no more electoral college, a bigger House with no Senate, the right to be represented, no appointing of senators, limiting terms for judges, requiring a balanced budget, limiting bills to single topics and requiring clarity, allowing legislation by public initiative, allowing recall elections, creating citizen assemblies, and developing a fourth (people's) branch of government.</div>

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">Due to a clerical error in the Supreme Court header notes of a decision made in the late 1800s, corporations have been granted all the rights of people. Legally speaking, they've been given "personhood" and therefore are entitled to all the rights of citizens enshrined in the Constitution, except for the right to vote.<br/>Consequently, corporations have been granted the right to "freedom of speech" which our founders had never envisioned. Furthermore, their ability to spend their economic resources in electoral politics has been determined to be an exercise of their free speech.<br/>Because corporations hold far more wealth than all the human citizens of the U.S. combined, they have massive undue influence in our electoral and political process. As a result, government often acts to benefit corporations and at the expense of the public.<br/>Over the years, giant corporations have continued to consolidate their power and control of our political system, our media, our educational system, our economy, our public institutions and even over the non-profit sector and our leisure and entertainment.<br/>This has not been good for our society, for our livelihoods, or for our government. If this trend is not stopped very soon, we will reach a point where it cannot be rolled back.<br/>The solution doesn't have to be complex. Revoking corporate "personhood" and enforcing existing laws would be a start.</div>

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">Here's the basis of my opinion.<br/><br/>It is illegal to use another's money - time - resources without their permission, to do so is considered a THEFT OF SERVICE.<br/><br/>To deny the same Individual the use of his own resources is a DENIAL OF SERVICE.<br/><br/>To intrude on an Individual's Privacy is a Constitutional Violation.<br/><br/>Now, to address Spammers, Telemarketers, and Junk Mailers - ATTENTION JUDGES!!!!! - FREE SPEECH CAN BE WITHHELD IF YOU'RE COMMITTING A CRIME IN DOING SO!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Free speech rights pertains to public forums ONLY.<br/><br/>In other words when a telemarketer calls, its a crime for what he is doing is a DENIAL OF SERVICE for the Owner of the phone - He can't receive his desired communications. A DENIAL OF SERVICE IN THE COMPUTER WORLD GETS 20 YEARS. It is no less of a crime to do it on a phone - AND THERE IS NO LEGAL DIFFERENCE!!!.<br/><br/>Also THEFT OF SERVICE charges apply.  The Telemarketer is accessing personal resources / equipment WITHOUT PERMISSION WHICH CONSTITUTES THEFT OF SERVICE.  This misconception of Telemarketer's rights originated back when Ma Bell owned all Phone Equipment and was a public service.<br/><br/>THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE AND EXISTING LAWS NEED TO BE ENFORCED.<br/><br/>The individual pays, and maintains phone and computer for SELF USE ONLY and it is NOT Public Equipment / Resources which can be used without permission - to do so is ALSO an invasion of privacy and is NOT a public forum where free speech rights are guaranteed.<br/><br/>The ONLY phones Telemarketers have a right to are PAY PHONES for they are public property.<br/><br/>The same applies to the internet and computers. To Impede and disrupt the effectiveness of an individuals resources with spam, forcebly recording it on equipment NOT OWNED BY THE SPAMMER and NOT PUBLIC EQUIPMENT, violating the individuals privacy, STEALING RESOURCES OF MONETARY VALUE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO DEAL WITH IT is Illegal. The Same as DENIAL OF SERVICE.<br/><br/>Spammers are COMMITING CRIMES IN NON PUBLIC FORUMS IN ORDER TO "PROMOTE THEIR FREE SPEECH".<br/><br/>Because of the violations of other individuals personal rights and the theft of resources - THEIR RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH IN THIS MANNER MAY BE CONSTITUTIONALLY DENIED!!!!  For where these instances of attempted free speech are being done is NOT a public Forum, NOT a public owned resource where free speech is guaranteed. So In doing so, FREE SPEECH RIGHTS DO NOT APPLY.<br/><br/>Now on the subject of Junk Mail  If I take my junkmail over to the mall plaza and go to throw it in the garbage dumpster, a sign on the dumpster says $2500 theft of service charge will be applied to unauthorized use.<br/><br/>Here's the clincher - There's NO DIFFERENCE between dumping junkmail in the dumpster or in my mailbox Legally.<br/><br/>Once again the mailbox was put there for my personal use, personally paid for and maintained.  To receive desired communications which I ORIGINATE / ELECT to receive.<br/><br/>The use of which unsolicited QUALIFYS AS A THEFT OF SERVICE OR A THEFT OF RESOURCES.<br/>The time an individual has to take to deal with junkmail has monetary value - the stealing of which is a crime when unsolicited.<br/><br/>People go AWWW it only takes a second to deal with it, but tell the family who didn't have a Living room when they saved all their junkmail for a year.<br/><br/>So according to junkmailers it's legal for me to contract the post office or other delivery service to deliver junk cars, debris, unwanted building product, refuse, to the white house to deal with at THEIR EXPENSE.<br/><br/>When you start talking of the expense of constantly dealing with large debris such as cars it WOULD get expensive and would be an OUTRIGHT THEFT of their resources, money and time<br/><br/>THERE IS NO LEGAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND WHAT HAPPENS EVERYDAY AT MY MAILBOX<br/><br/>Just because you can pay to have something delivered does NOT mean in any form is legal.<br/><br/>Here's How privacy is supposed to work,   I want to buy a car, so I go online and elect to receive solicitations for a period of 1 to 3 months after which my privacy rights are reenacted and all junk mail MUST stop.  None of this electing to receive mail from partners crap, where they just change their name and solicit again, the individual must have elected to receive directly (They just keep changing their name saying they are a partner to which you subscribed) Only legal communications are solicited.<br/><br/>The ONLY constitutionally legal means of advertising are newspapers, TV, magazines etc. where the individual ELECTS to purchase said content KNOWING it contains advertising.<br/><br/>This is where the lobbying of politicians has been paying off.<br/><br/>Sad Part is almost everybody doesn't realize their privacy rights AND USE OF their resources are being ignored in the SUPPOSED legal form of free speech.<br/><br/><br/>Once again, Free Speech rights CANNOT be claimed when a CRIME IS BEING COMMITTED IN A NON- PUBLIC AND NON-PUBLIC OWNED FORUM.<br/><br/>The constitution doesn't say anything about jumping through hoops and spending large amounts of money to deny junkmail, spamming, telemarketers to receive privacy rights and right to limit use of PERSONAL RESOURCES to oneself. And the large bulk of spam together, and telemarketers constitutes harrasment<br/><br/>THE JUDGES AND LAWYERS HAVE THE TEETH TO DEAL WITH BUT REFUSE TO USE against spammers, telemarketers, and Junkmailers.<br/><br/>Time to vote some one in who'll enforce existing laws WHICH ARE ADEQUATE.<br/><br/>The garbage in garbage dumps will decrease 2/3's - Fewer trees will need to be cut protecting our resources<br/>Privacy will finally be done and decided by who it's intended for - the individual himself and these problems will have been dealt with according to the Constitution - WHAT A CONCEPT!!!<br/><br/>And the penalty to those commiting these crimes? Payback of all the man hours dealing with their garbage, Uh, let's see,  10 million incidents of spam time times taking each individual's monetary valued time of 1 minute to deal with it its............LIFE IN PRISON!!!!!!<br/><br/>get the picture?Huh</div>

Greed, arrogance, stupidity, education errors, cultural blind spots+<br/>We propose that directors, officers, and editors do something unusual to benefit humanity which will also correct internal management errors, offer many new and expanded business opportunities, and improve your profitability. Start with the obvious. ➤Physics proved our universe is a MultiDimensional Holographic SubSystem.

Study why our best universities and firms ignore 37+ studies of Natural Healing System Vegetarian Diet Prevention saving 56% to 68% of health costs, reducing illnesses 76% to 83%. This will reduce retirement and employee costs. Media, even NYT Jane Brody, promote malnutrition, ignoring research on biological nutrition, with 56% to 68% cost savings on Vegetarian Diet Healing and Prevention, 76%-83% less illness. Why??? ➤US Govt says to use all whole grains. White bread is proven to cause two health problems. The lack of 26 nutrients missing from white flour and 19 from white rice are proven to injure health in many ways, directly involved in many health problems. None or very little sugar, low salt, no junk food. Tax all junk and non foods $10-$30. Per Pound or Item to improve health and to recover costs to taxpayers of health problems caused by malnutrition. Junk foods are deadly. Why promote illness, death?<br/>	➤Sane cultures will use Prevention on all problems. Most Humans Don’t. I ask that you assume that Geniuses in all fields are right, examine the research, evidence sources, and references on the forefront of science and human knowledge conflicting with beliefs. Sociology Cultural Psychology and history show why and how we ignore new discoveries and info. We still shoot Whistle Blowers even in the hard sciences and in seeking solutions for problems. There are 428+ books by historians on how establishments shoot innovators and whistle blowers, today as throughout history. We are the same people now.➤Examine the 46 scientific discoveries that created major Paradigm Shifts, the Forefront of Science, Physics, Sociology, Weather Change Research, Education, Training, Biology, Holistic Health, Healing Victim’s Body Mind Systems, Safety, Prevention of Rape, Violence, Crime, Murder, Greed, Vested Interest Pressures and Distortions. Results will surprise you.  Geniuses are almost always right, yet Sociology finds are ignored for two to hundreds of generations.<br/>	➤Twenty five studies validate Holistic Health, saving 80%. Read the 1997 President’s Health Committee 23 person Holistic Health study reporting ➤“Holistic Health Is Valid.

Why??? ➤This is a major crime.<br/>	➤Examine why you’ve missed evidence in so many fields proving establishments info false or distorted. ➤USA officials put info on serious errors and actual crimes under Secret or Executive Privilege to hide illegal actions and their major or embarrassing goofs. Pass laws making these coverups very serious Felonies, with mandatory very long jail sentences.  ➤➤President Jimmy Carter writes that USA Bush Government used 50+ designations to restrict unclassified information, created 81%<br/> more secrets in 2005 then in 2000, reported by www.OpenTheGovernment.org. <br/>	Our summary of geniuses info indicates 23 + Pulitzer Prize stories. ➤The Union Of Concerned Scientists Web Page reports show Bush acted illegally.

Results–twenty two+ agencies and groups falsified info. Only two people quit in protest. HHS falsified web page, publications, even phone info. Said “Abstinence is the only way to prevent STD’s and pregnancy”. This is proven to raise pregnancy and STD rates considerably. ➤HHS fails to Use Eleven Elements of the New Scientific Method Physics requires, systems research, accident and error prevention training, ignores and suppresses 25 Studies Validating Holistic Health, with 80% savings and abilities to heal all problems. US Government was paid under the table for 82 years to eliminate MD’s competitors and put MD’s in full charge of US “Health Care” systems. MD Illness Care Is Not Health Care. MD’s are Pharmaceutical Shills. Study why NY Times reporters and editors suppressed all of this info. Many told NYT and most media about it. Do major expose’s on Educator’s, governments, and media’s many very damaging failures. Media have been told about the 212+ books on the 1838 ongoing MD war against Alternative Medicine.  Ignored. <br/>	➤Zoology Research proved by 1999 that over 450 species have homosexuals. It’s illegal to not allow marriage for gays and lesbians. Religions and non profits lying about gays and lesbians, killing many, must lose their tax exemptions under IRS regulations. They must forfeit all business and professional licenses! All involved are actively promoting violence and murder, and actively aiding and abetting suicide. All Individuals and Groups involved are Guilty of Crimes.➤FIRST Amendment outlaws laws against stem cell research, abortion, and any homosexual marriage or other activities.<br/>➤Government Elected and Hired Officials have no immunity for actions aiding and promoting murder by lying about homosexuals, Health Care, suppressing Holistic Health Healing, Prevention, not requiring safety training that reduces accidents and errors 98%-99.7%, increasing creativity, violence prevention tools, and overpopulation past farmland’s ability to feed them, destroying ecological systems. This causes starvation. One+ Billion will starve by 2100, Six Billion by 2140. Overpopulation is the major factor in violence, war, and destruction of ecological systems. These actions and inactions are manslaughter and genocide. Management, Educators, Governments, and Editors fail to be truthful.<br/>       ➤Military and State Dept. Ignored Cultural Psychology Research on Islamic Societies,  safety training that eliminates 98% to 99.7% of accidents and errors, Holistic Health validation, regeneration feasibility, scientific devices that eliminate pests, improve health, safety, solve problems, aid R & D projects, plus much else. <br/>➤➤➤Add a Holistic Health Editor and writers. MD writers suppress science in health, still sure that all other healers are quacks, aiding the 1838 to present MD war against Alternative Medicine that paid Congress 82 years cash under the table to eliminate MD’s competitors. ➤Congress still takes five kinds of payoff’s, almost everyone is subject to brain washing. Photos have been used to blackmail many. It’s far Cheaper to own politicians then to pay them off. ➤Retrain all editors and writers on the forefront of science and knowledge in all fields, the implications of Systems Research, Paradigm Shifts, of  Being an Integrated Part of a Holographic Universe, the many lessons of history, and how we continue to suppress new to us info now as throughout history. ➤➤Humans still teach very sanitized history. Sociology Cultural Psychology research proved that Cultural Conditioning Is Hypnotic in Character. That is why advertising sells. Humans take two to hundreds, even thousands of generations to get “New To Us” info conflicting with beliefs into establishments and cultures. Law schools teach that 50 witnesses to a staged event will give almost 50 different descriptions of what happened. <br/> ➤➤➤Teach all to question establishment info. Carefully examine and check evidence and references on any data conflicting with cultural norms, belief systems, mind set. <br/>	What “We Absolutely Know Is So” is often found false by science. <br/>	➤Science has a very bad habit. Science keeps proving that establishments are wrong.<br/>		➤Whistle Blowing!   WHAT IF Our Geniuses Are Right??? ➤➤➤ www.serendipityassn.org <br/>	An Honest Evaluation of Geniuses Research Summaries requires reading all key articles. <br/>➤”A Basic Cultural Urgent Problems GIGO Data Bases”, Education, Libraries, Peace, Media NYT, Media Ethics, Ed Scientific Method, Fix, Risk, Agriculture, Govt, Safety, Security, ACLU, Military, Health Enhancement References+Study 190+ articles-SA Web.

A Physics Nobel Prize Winner reports that “Everything is Mind Stuff”. Well Proven.<br/>➤Reality is a MultiDimensional Holographic SubSystem. Physics requires using all Eleven Elements of A New Scientific Method, plus Four Design of Experiment Tools often needed to be scientific. Physics explains: Energy Healing as Applied Physics, Psychotronics, Radionics, Pyramid Energies, Safety, Spatial Relationships, Psychic Phenomena, why we avoid collisions dancing, driving, and much else. ➤One percent can see Auras, 5% of kids, and 63% can learn to see them clearly. Many see patterns in Auras, enabling them to pick out dangerous people, violent, criminals, stress, illness, fatigue, error prone, all other problems. <br/>➤Time Is Proven To Be An Illusion, so some can identify problems before they appear. Listen to your feelings, to the still small voice within.<br/>	Physics proved MD mechanistic systems concepts are wrong. People are Completely Integrated Holographic Mind Body Energy Field Spirit SubSystems. This is the foundation for Holistic Health Healing, and explains thirty two safety studies with 98% to 99.7% less accidents and errors in the study groups doing Yoga, Tai Chi, Meditation, and Aikido. Clear all energy field distortions with MariEL Reiki to do even better. Learn why small women-girls, can’t be attacked successfully by five men after two years of Aikido. Training increases intuitive awareness of danger, error, best action, creativity, and the rate of invention. ➤People avoid danger. This aids security, works much better when we add Meditation, Yoga, Tai Chi. <br/>	➤➤Why ignore NLP permanent stress removal, Instrumentation showing Acupuncture Points, Meridian Lines, and Chakras, Energy Healing validation as Applied Physics by 42 studies, 53 studies report all viruses, bacteria disappear. Why/How DoD spent $195,639,238 on Psychic Research thru 2001. Top Brass cancelled nine research projects-3-02. DoD goofed in not using them. These are Major Stories. See Fix and Security articles.<br/>	➤Holistic Health is validated by twenty five studies, saves 80%+, found valid by the President’s Health Committee 23 person study in 1997, yet their report was suppressed. I talked with them. Natural Healing System Vegetarian Diet Prevention Studies find 56% to 68% savings with 76% to 83% less illness. Media, educators, non food, junk food, anti nutrition marketing. Cultures promote malnutrition, causing birth defects, illness, killing babies, children, and adults. Learn why we still have an 1838 to present war against Alternative Medicine, reported in 212+ books, with 483+ MD’s losing their MD license for working successfully with any Alternative Medicine modalities, even BioNutrition and Herbs. ➤The 981 who were charged spent many millions protecting their MD licenses. Call their attorneys. I talked with eight.<br/>➤➤➤There are five types of payoffs today. <br/>➤➤➤MD’s paid Congress cash under the table for 82 years to take charge of health care and eliminate all of their Alternative Medicine competition, even herbs and nutrition. Study 212+ books on the ongoing war against Alternative Medicine, Suppressing Science in Health, Healing, and Prevention. MD’s fail to research the actual causes of each mind body health problems. Science requires research on the causes of any problem. Prevention is always far less costly. These are all ongoing major White Collar Crimes!<br/>➤We ignore Mind Body Health Problem Prevention. Eight Public Health grads told me that arthritis and diabetes are cured by herbs and diet. Cataracts also. ➤Holistic Health eliminates the need for over 90% of pharmaceuticals by Healing all of the Actual Causes of  Problems. Drugs often suppress symptoms, and seldom fix causes. ➤Eight attorneys told me that all have winnable lawsuits against MD’s, medical organizations, HHS, all health nonprofits, and media for aiding the 1838 to present MD HHS ongoing war against science in health care. <br/>➤➤This ongoing RICO is a true conspiracy. <br/>Attorneys report that this is ilegal Theft by Deception, Criminal Malfeasance, and Manslaughter. Raising funds to find cures when Holistic Health has proven able to cure All Mind Body Health Problems is quite illegal. This Violates the Deceptive Practices Act and kills many people daily.<br/>➤➤➤Elected officials, management, and MD’s are criminally liable for aiding manslaughter in aiding MD and safety errors and crimes.

This is Mandatary to break human’s inherent habit of discounting any new to them info that conflicts with the actual inherent Mind Set of people and establishments. Why report AS IF 1800's info on science, sociology, and history is true???  Media will increase circulation IF they report honestly on Geniuses info.

We still fail to act, even in the face of our experience that the design of most government systems requires elected officials to raise massive amounts of money for elections.  This results in them acting in favor of establishment contributors, and against the best interests of people, ecologies, the actual needs of people, society, and long term human survival.  Examine the evidence on political sellouts throughout our history reported in 783+ books, and the major sellouts today in health, safety, education, agriculture, violence, crime, justice systems design, and in handling info, ignoring problem prevention, definition, actual causes, interrelationships, systems, and valid scientifically based solutions. Leaders, their key people, and staffs all fail to consider or verify Whistle Blowers and University info. There are 428 histories on establishments shooting down innovators and whistle blowers, often literally.  Major sellouts were shown by the failure to examine and act on the President’s Health Committee 23 person Holistic Health study 1997  report “Holistic Health is valid, Integrate It, Save Lives, Suffering, Billions”. Neither Clinton nor the public was told that they had the info on curing 99%+ of breast and skin cancer, vision, stress, AIDS, and all other mind body health problems of any nature. I talked with them. The report was suppressed. Why? ➤➤Who did it? Who ordered it ignored to suppress science in health care??? Greed?<br/>➤Pharmaceutical MD money buys votes. MD’s running the Health Committee suppressed the Holistic Health study results. Brain washing works. Payoffs help. MD systems. MD  schools all promote pills, not science. Drugs are seldom needed.

Agriculture and weather cycle studies find that Earth will only be able to feed one billion people in the 2100's, even IF we develop new power sources from the underlying structure of matter. Physics and other research indicates this is feasible. Oil is gone by 2100. ➤➤➤Earth can only support 500 million without oil. Fuels are used by Agriculture. Can’t grow fuel and food. Both require crop land and fuel. Do corn bio fuels use 1.29 gallons of oil to produce and deliver one gallon of bio fuel, only 70% as powerful???<br/>➤All structures must be built for very low energy use. Straw bale construction, triple glazed windows, fireproof construction, and solar panels are urgently needed. Fossil fuel availability is decreasing rapidly. Ergonomic design, low maintenance design, lightning rods, fireproof construction, and very low energy use is less costly over the life of buildings. Saves money on insurance and saves lives. Not requiring this kills some people.<br/>	➤Home and Business  Insurance Firms Violate Deceptive Practices Act When They Fail to Cover Full Replacement Value. Why no criminal charges??? Do we need more laws, or are we failing to apply current laws???<br/>	IRS seems to act illegally when they tax property sales without adjusting purchase price to the dollars current value. Isn’t it illegal to tax nonexistent profit of depreciated dollars?<br/>➤Promote Solar Panel efficiency research. National and international building codes are important. Psychotronic devices from many firms like Pyradyne Inc in LA will make all buildings and areas more livable. ➤Buy Pyradyne’s Laser OmniOrb, with 163 times the energy of a standard pyramid, demonstrate for all your people, use for research . Get prices from them, order through us, check made out to them, and we get credit. ➤➤They and others make Medallions that eliminate Jet Lag. No Jet Lag is important to all travelers and government. Yet Media, DOD, State, Educators ignore device research and Physics. “Science, What’s That?” attitude is very damaging and costly. <br/>	We need to plan ahead in all fields. ➤➤➤Farms use oil. ➤How many people can Earth feed without good crop weather and fuel? ➤Perhaps 500 Million IF We Rebuild Ecologies we depended on throughout human history..  Earth’s Population in 200 AD Is All Earth Can Support with weather changes and no oil.  Talk with Prof Milton Searle, UCSD Biology Dept.<br/> ➤Get George Kuepper’s 2006 report on Radionic and Tower devices, SA web Ag.. Appropriate Technology Transfer For Rural Areas, 16,000 farmers, and USN research in 1984 report “Radionic Devices Eliminate All Insect Pests, Viruses, Bacteria, Fungus, and Mold from any target area, using different frequencies for each item”. Saves farmer’s budgets 17%-22%+, keeps toxins out of food and environment, saves farm workers lives, and improves health for everyone. They increase soil fertility. They will remove any insect pest, bacteria, viruses, fungus, and mold from commercial buildings, houses, hospitals+. Make soils more fertile. No fertilizers or poisons. Use after floods and storms. ➤Tower Devices make plants and animals healthier and calmer in a 2,500 acre area, reducing farm birth defects 98.4%. Pregnant women near a Tower for nine months will tend to be free of birth defects. Place these throughout all cities. These devices are ignored, suppressed, as they are only explained by Quantum Physics. ➤Radionic Devices will eliminate all biowarfare agents, yet DoD fails to study them. Military has eight major errors, 23 altogether. We’ve mailed Joint Chiefs, DoD, and State Dept since 1992. General Powell received our material in 1992. Didn’t respond to mail or phone calls. ➤FDA closed two firms for daring to state that Radionics eliminates viruses and bacteria. D.C. Post Office needs these now.<br/>	We urgently need to require that all elected, appointed, and hired key people, decision makers, researchers,. and their staffs have a high IQ, Mensa level or more, and the ability to pass a test on the forefront of science, history, sociology, human knowledge, all of the interrelationships in science and knowledge, and the  implications of systems research, physics proof that all we deal with, and us, are Completely Integrated, Interrelated MultiDimensional Holographic SubSystems of a MultiDimensional Holographic Universe, Cost Benefit Analysis, Cause Effect Studies, and Long Term Effects of Actions.. This is urgent for all school and university boards, media, corporations, security, government officials, staffs, politicians, kids, and all people. Our Holographic Universe requires Eleven Elements of the New Scientific Method, and often Four Design of Experiment Modalities to be scientific.  ➤➤Optimum decisions can’t be made on a badly GIGO’d data base.  Geniuses data at the forefront of science and knowledge is needed by all involved in decisions, education, information handling, children, cultures, research, and life. Earth can’t afford decisions made with ignorance of accurate data, or to please Vested Interests, greed, and power.<br/> GIGO’d info is costly and deadly.<br/>	➤World Peace and World Health are feasible Only IF we correct all 22 errors in education world wide, and use all of the info geniuses have developed for all planning, raising children, education, and all actions. <br/>	We can increase creativity, reduce populations rapidly, eliminate violence and actions against people and Earth, yet we make no effort to apply geniuses info that will make sane survivable societies feasible.<br/>➤➤When all leaders know we face eight possible and probable disasters, learn what our geniuses have discovered, and how very damaging actions based on false info are, many will change their destructive habits of thought and action. Some will renounce war to act for human survival. Business and cultures act to make destruction of ecologies and weather changes far worse. There are 32 studies of training that reduces accidents and errors 98% to 99.7% by increasing intuitive awareness of errors, best action, and danger. They avoid danger and errors. The study groups work with Yoga, Tai Chi, Meditation, and Aikido. Studies have been reported in our literature since 1938, every paper 7-87, an AP story on the 32nd study.  ➤Failure to require this training for all drivers, pilots, parents, children, espionage, military, security, firemen, and leaders results in many avoidable deaths and injuries. Training reduces violence in schools, families, and cultures, increasing creativity and rates of invention. <br/>	➤Governments, both elected and hired officials, HHS, DoD, corporations, Homeland Security, educators, media, corporations, HR management, and all staffs  are involved in these ongoing crimes.<br/>	➤The scientific method requires questioning all assumptions. Read “Education Scientific Method, Eleven Elements”. Four Design of Experiment Tools Often Necessary to be Scientific. Study all SA articles and evidence.<br/>➤False Assumptions are dangerous and very expensive. Always ask who disagrees with establishments and why. They are often, not always, right. Examine all of the evidence far more  carefully when it conflicts with your belief system. Check evidence, references. <br/>	➤Let’s correct all of the actual basic causes of our many problems and apply the forefront of science and knowledge in all areas of life and human survival! <br/>➤Stop the extremely damaging Discrimination, Discount, and Bigotry Against Geniuses and Their Discoveries. Promote very long term planning ahead for thousands of years. Examine Effects of Actions Over Ten Centuries and Over Eons. ➤Promote effective systems planning ahead in all that we do for at least 100,000 years. Act AS IF humanity was going to live on Earth for more then a few years. <br/>Why continue to act to destroy humanities’ increasingly small chance of survival???<br/>➤➤Call me re receipt, references, and actions planned.  ➤Encourage Whistle Blowing. <br/>➤Help create a major nonprofit to offer rewards, protection, better jobs, education, and relocation if needed, for all who identify problems and coverups in our culture and world. Publicize the five types of payoffs rampant in our culture and world, the damage done by the Good Old Boys Network, and how both act against babies, children, women, families, men, cultures, ecology, and both short and long term human ecological survival. Require criminal penalties against all who act against people and long term survival. We are far past any possibility of comfortable human survival.<br/>➤Does any religion’s teaching say to promote starvation and war by pushing overpopulation and destroying ecological systems??? Or to kill women by forcing pregnancy and birth??? Or to ignore and lie about health, healing, and prevention tools???<br/>	➤➤➤GIGO’d information systems are very costly of lives and wealth. Decisions based on false or distorted info wastes lives and money.  We have destroyed ecological systems at an increasing rate, do even worse each year. <br/>➤We are out of oil before 2100. <br/>➤Emphasize that science keeps proving ‘What We Absolutely Know Is So’ is quite incorrect, and what happens when establishments are caught in serious errors, omissions, fantasies, and fraud.  ➤➤Teach how and why Matriarchal Cultures are far more effective in meeting the needs of children, families, adults, ecologies, and long term survival. They always do far better at seeing the complete system, all details, planning for all needs, planning for the future. ➤➤➤If you want jobs done right, hire women.  ➤Will humans reduce world population 93% to 500 million, or starve six billion by 2140??? <br/>➤We must rebuild ecologies rapidly to support even 500 million next century.<br/>	➤We are very far past any possibility of comfortable human and ecological survival.<br/>Our best universities prove unable to examine research or listen to professors proving errors. Cross disciplinary education is urgent, as all departments info applies to all others. Physics, Sociology, and History clarify major errors. Science enables many opportunities for research, health, healing, and problem solving not feasible with the proven false mechanistic concepts.<br/>Graduates lack basic info on the implications of Holographic MultiDimensional SubSystems, Systems research, cause effect relationships, cost benefit analysis, the many lessons of history, how Science keeps proving wrong what we absolutely know is so, why Geniuses new information is ignored for two to hundreds, sometimes thousands of generations, when it conflicts with Basic Beliefs, why Mind Set takes precedence over new scientific information and research, and both how and why we take many generations to act on new to us info. There are 428+ books by historians on establishment habit of shooting innovators and whistle blowers, today as throughout history. We are still the same biologically designed people, all but 4.6% unable to even consider new info that conflicts with their beliefs, their Mind Set!!! This is inherent in the biological design of ALL SPECIES, literally designed in to all humans. ➤➤We evolved in tribal cultures. We still think and act with tribal attitudes and responses.<br/>	Why do you feel you have to keep proving that Sociologists are correct by refusing to examine evidence, research, science, sociology, and history???   Geniuses exist in universities and throughout all cultures. Why ignore their findings??? Addre</div>

Public work forgiveness programs are filled with loopholes that exclude those who have borrowed significant amounts and who have been paying for a longer time. We are creating a society of permanent indebtedness which prevents all but the very rich and very poor from exploring careers in less than profitable, but vital liberal arts.  if we cannot reduce education costs then we must help students to bear this burden.  If we can't expand forgiveness programs, then we should consider all borrowers to deduct the full amount of interest accrued on their loans as we do for homeowners.  </div>

<div id="IdeaScale_IdeaContent">Our nation's schoolchildren abide such rules everyday--so why is government allowed to fill libraries with the mind-numbingly complex literature that is income tax law? Congress must scrap the existing income tax regulation in favor of something the American public, even they themselves, can read. As was shown by the tax-code embarrassments of  Timothy Geithner and Kathleen Sebelius, even the authors of our income tax laws find them utterly unreadable.<br/><br/>America needs to have a tax code it can read within a week, not several lifetimes. The fact that a billion-dollar industry that revolves solely around completing your income taxes for you is shameful and reflective of the government-sponsored confusion the IRS has created.<br/><br/>Furthermore, simplifying the income tax system will reap benefits for the American people and business. Even the IRS stands to gain, as it can more easily find the true tax evaders, not just the innocent ones who misread a bit of the legalese. Small-business owners will no longer lose valuable time sifting through complex taxation literature or have to pay their entire profit to a company like H&R Block. By streamlining the income tax, it will be a second stimulus to small businesses across America.<br/><br/>What I advocate is none less than an extension of these criticisms:<br/>-Whether it be through Congressional legislation or by Geither if he as such authority over the IRS (which I doubt) is to publish a document, 100 pages, double spaced and in 12-point Times New Roman, that contains the full form of income taxes for the individual and business. <br/>-If Congressional action is required, then make it clear that this is not a subversive method of raising taxes. Do not touch tax rates. However, the well-concealed loopholes manipulated by the petrochemicals industry and big-businesses will have to be dropped to fit the length limit.<br/></div>
