Scrapes data from http://opengov.ideascale.com

Getting Started:
mkdir _cache
mkdir _output
ruby scrape.rb

Notes:
1. Make sure that the _cache and _output directories exist before you run scrape.rb
2. Clear out the _cache directory if you want to pull down fresh content
3. This code is rough and could use improvement! :)
